CONTENT: After all the drama of a campaign like no other, US election day is here. It’s been an ultra-close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and more twists and turns are guaranteed after polls close on 5 November.So settle in, and buckle up. Our election night guide includes the key things to watch out for as we wait to get a result - however long that wait proves to be. Timings below are given in GMT first and then in US Eastern time (EST).After months of second-guessing what the American public will decide, at 17:00 EST (22:00 GMT) we got an early glimpse into their thoughts and motivations, with early exit poll data suggesting democracy and the economy are the most important issues for voters.American exit polls work differently to those in the UK. Rather than predicting the result, they give an insight into people’s priorities and opinions  - and later, into how different demographic groups voted. Pollsters combine election day interviews with telephone polling both nationally and in the seven swing states.Throughout the night, expect experts to talk a lot about these states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In most states the outcome of the presidential vote is all but certain but voting in swing states is hard to predict and can lean Republican (red) or Democrat (blue). Both campaigns have been heavily targeting voters in these battleground areas that could hold the keys to the White House.By 00:00 GMT (19:00 EST), polls will be closing in Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, but these are not swing states, so the results will be predictable.But voting will also close in the first swing state of the night, Georgia. Victory for either candidate could give a strong hint at which way the election could go.Georgia was only narrowly won by Joe Biden last time. It also became the subject of false claims by Trump, who is accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his 2020 defeat.The candidate with more votes than any other in Georgia will get 16 crucial votes out of 538 under the electoral college system.Harris and Trump both want to gain a majority of 270 electoral college votes to win the White House. That matters more than the "popular vote" or the nationwide support they receive.Soon afterwards, at 00:30 GMT (19:30 EST), polls close in three more states including in North Carolina.Away from the presidential contest, there's been huge interest in the state governor contest that pits state Attorney General Josh Stein against Trump-backed candidate Mark Robinson, whose campaign has been hit by scandals.Polls close at the same time in Ohio, where Trump's running mate JD Vance is a senator. Meanwhile, the two campaigns will be gathering at their headquarters for the evening – which we know will be in West Palm Beach, Florida, in Trump’s case. Harris is expected to spend some of the night at Howard University in Washington DC, where she was once a student.At this point, some states might start to be “called” by US media outlets. They use models to project, or call, which way a state has voted, even before the full vote count has been completed.This happens when they believe a candidate has gained a lead that cannot be beaten by their opponent. In some closely-fought swing states, this could take a long time.The models the media outlets use draw on a variety of data, such as exit polls and actual votes counted by officials. The BBC gets this data from a firm named Edison Research.At 01:00 GMT (20:00 EST), more polls close - including in critical Pennsylvania, the biggest prize of the 2024 swing states with 19 electoral votes. This is where Trump survived an attempt on his life when a gunman opened fire at his rally, killing one person.It's also a state that's part of the Rust Belt - areas once dominated by manufacturing that have experienced industrial decline in recent decades. Here, a handful of counties, like Erie and Northampton, could end up making a difference.Around now, at 01:30 GMT (20:30 EST), we expect to get more exit poll data - including a national breakdown of voting by age, race, and level of college education. This is provisional data that's refined over a period of weeks.Polls close at 02:00 GMT (21:00 EST) in more closely-watched battleground states including Michigan and Wisconsin. Michigan is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the US, for many of whom the Israel-Gaza war is an important electoral issue. The state was won by Biden last time, as was Wisconsin, which this year hosted the Republican National Convention.Polls also shut in Arizona - a focal point for the nation’s immigration debate - followed by Nevada, where both parties have tried to appeal to working-class voters by vowing to end taxes on tips, an hour later.At 04:00 GMT (23:00 EST), polls close across the remaining states that adjoin each other on the US mainland. The last two states close slightly later - Hawaii at 05:00 GMT (00:00 EST) and Alaska at 06:00 GMT on Wednesday (01:00 EST).Traditionally, it was soon after the close of voting at 23:00 EST in California that the race as a whole was called for one candidate or the other. A concession speech from the losing candidate followed not long later.But few observers are expecting a speedy resolution this year, with some suggesting it could take days, rather than hours, to know the victor.In recent elections, an increased number of postal votes has tended to delay the process. Tens of millions of people have also voted early, ahead of polling day. And different states have different rules on when they start tallying them.Early tallies may also be deceptive. A candidate who takes an early lead through in-person votes may end up being overtaken when postal votes and other types of ballots are added later. This happened in Michigan in 2020. Trump took an early lead through in-person votes but was later overtaken by Biden.Despite so much focus on the presidency, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress, who pass laws and initiate spending plans. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election. In the Senate, where members vote on key appointments in government, 34 seats are being contested.Republicans currently control the House, while Democrats have the Senate.These two chambers can act as a check on White House plans if the controlling party in either chamber disagrees with the president.Voters in Montana, Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota will also be asked how their state should regulate abortion, which has become one of the election's most emotive issues.If you're still up, well done for making it this far, but there's a chance we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out who has won. The tighter the race, the more vote-counting that will need to happen before a winner can be projected in any given place - and there is always the possibility of recounts. The full nationwide count usually takes days or weeks.To give you a flavour – in 2020, the result in Pennsylvania and Nevada was projected four days after election day, and in Arizona, after more than a week by most outlets.A very close contest could feel like a repeat of 2020. Or 2024 could be comparable to the 2000 presidential race between George W Bush and Al Gore, which was disputed and ultimately settled in the US Supreme Court, with Bush certified as the winner.The neck-and-neck vote predicted by the polls and pundits in 2024 could potentially leave the door open to legal challenges by either side.That would make the night only the beginning of the drama – rather than the final word on the 2024 election.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Donald Trump's return to the White House will have a hugely negative effect on climate change action in the short-term but the longer term impact is less certain, experts say.With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a "scam".But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change. The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration."The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck," said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute."They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything."In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute."The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook," Prof Klein said.Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China."You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy," Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News."You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers."There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration."The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action," said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief."But it cannot and will not halt the changes under way to decarbonise the economy and meet the goals of the Paris agreement."Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.Outside the UK?

CONTENT: A Donald Trump impressionist has said his phone did not stop ringing after the result of the 2024 US presidential election.Mike Osman, a comedian from Southampton, was almost ready to retire his blonde wig and fake tan.But news of the Republican's return to the White House has inspired him to carry on.After launching his act in 2016, he now describes himself as the UK's number one Trump impersonator.With more than 16 million views on TikTok, Mr Osman has spent years working on his act, named Donald Trumped.Despite having a southern English accent, the comedian seems to imitate Trump's voice with ease."The first thing you've got to do is get the wig - and you've got to get it right," he said.The impressionist wears a bespoke hairpiece created by wig designers, which is regularly re-styled by a hairdresser.Next is perfecting the costume, in particular Trump's suit and iconic crimson tie."The tie is about eight foot long," he joked, adding his seamstress neighbour had made it especially for him.But the most important part of being a Donald Trump impersonator, he said, was replicating his eyes and mouth."I have watched a lot of videos of Donald, believe me," he added.The morning after the presidential election in November, Mr Osman said demand for his act was high."I'm non-political, I have no axe to grind doing Donald Trump, the American people have decided," he said."I'm the UK's number one Donald Trump impersonator - interestingly, I'm in the top five in the world, according to a survey."Mr Osman grew up on a council estate in Millbrook, a suburb of Southampton."Nothing wrong with that," he said."But if you'd have said to me when I was growing up in Millbrook that I would be the top five in the world at anything, you know, I'd have taken that."President-elect Donald Trump will take office in January.You can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.The line towards Bournemouth is blocked and trains are unable to run.The president-elect said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on China on his first day in office.The 1960s aircraft is set to be transformed after Solent Sky Museum salvaged it from a scrapheap.The emergency department at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth promises a "better experience" for patients.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.

CONTENT: The US will still continue fighting climate change and curbing its emissions of planet-warming gases despite the election of Donald Trump, the US special envoy told the COP29 conference on its opening day.John Podesta, a Biden administration appointee, labelled the incoming president a climate denier and said he would dismantle environmental safeguards.But in a sign of some early progress, country representatives struck an agreement over a long-standing sticking point in international climate negotiations.The move could allow richer countries to make up for some of their atmosphere-heating pollution by investing in clean energy projects or forests in developing nations.The election of Trump last week was a worrying development for action on climate change, as least in the short term experts have said.“He has vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement," Mr Podesta said.“That is what he has said, and we should believe him."The 2015 Paris agreement saw countries agree to try to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C.Leaders from nearly 100 countries will address the meeting in the coming days.COP29 had been billed as an opportunity to solve the crucial issue of getting money to poorer countries to help them deal with the impacts of climate change and help them prepare for it.But expectations for what the summit can achieve have been lowered by a Trump victory that makes Biden administration negotiators from one of the world's largest carbon emitters a lame duck in this process and unable to really promise much.However, the election wasn’t the end of the struggle, Mr Podesta told reporters.He believed that as a result of the policies put in place by President Biden and with the support of states and cities, US emissions would continue their downward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace.“The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle and one country. This fight is bigger still because we are living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world."As evidence that countries will continue to make progress on the issue, in the absence of leadership from the US, delegates signed off the final and most controversial component of the Paris climate agreement late on the first night of COP29.It means that a global 'carbon market' can now been established, allowing richer nations to pay for projects in developing nations that reduce emissions and use this to meet their climate obligations. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas released by human activities.This proposal is very attractive to richer countries in Europe as it is far cheaper to pay for a wind farm somewhere in Africa, for example, than to subsidise heat pumps at home.Agreed over this had proved very tricky. There have been concerns about fraud and whether the carbon removals are real and permanent.And despite it being passed some of those concerns remain, but supporters say it could unleash a flurry of market activity, worth up to $250bn a year flowing from rich to poor.As a reminder to negotiators of the urgency of the situation there was fresh scientific gloom. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in a report released to coincide with the conference's start, that 2024 is on track to be the world’s warmest year on record.Its latest State of the Climate report also finds that our oceans are heating up rapidly and glacier melt is accelerating.“We are on the road to ruin,” Mukhtar Babyaev, president of COP29 said in his opening remarks.He went on to list examples of climate impacts now around the world, saying “these are not future problems” as rising temperatures were doing huge damage around the world right now.The mood of delegates wasn't improved by the scale of the main task facing negotiators here.Amid energy and economic crises, developed countries are expected to find billions extra in climate finance for developing nations.Richer countries are willing to increase their contributions, as long as major emerging economies like China and the Gulf states also chip in.UN climate change chief Simon Stiell said that two thirds of the world cannot afford to cut emissions quickly enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold alive.If they didn’t get the cash to cut their carbon, everyone suffers, he said.“Let's dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity. An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest,” he told delegates.One issue exercising the minds and pockets of attendees at this gathering is the price of food and drink in the conference centreOur colleague Aygul Mehman, a journalist with the BBC’s Azerbaijani service, was charged 41 AZN (the Azerbaijani currency) for her modest lunch of soup, a bean salad and a dry roll. That’s about £18 ($24)."It’s like they are taking money from our pockets," one delegate told BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt as he was queuing up for food.This is a serious issue. Delegates from poorer nations often complain about how much these big conferences cost them when you add in flights and hotels and the total can come to many thousands of pounds.It hoped to provide direct flights to destinations like the east coast of America and the Middle East.After being absent for more than a century, salmon have been spotted in Oregon's Klamath River Basin, following a mammoth dam removal project in California.The international centre, opening on Monday, will focus on sharing knowledge and providing training.The new deal offers $300bn (about £240) a year to developing nations by 2035.The Samoan chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States explains why some of developing nations left the talks in Baku.

CONTENT: When US President Joe Biden walked through Kyiv in February 2023 on a surprise visit to show solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, air sirens were wailing. “I felt something… more strongly than ever before,” he later recalled. “America is a beacon to the world.”The world now waits to see who takes charge of this self-styled beacon after Americans make their choice in next week’s presidential election. Will Kamala Harris carry on in Biden’s footsteps with her conviction that in “these unsettled times, it is clear America cannot retreat”? Or will it be Donald Trump with his hope that “Americanism, not globalism” will lead the way?We live in a world where the value of US global influence is under question. Regional powers are going their own way, autocratic regimes are making their own alliances, and the devastating wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere are raising uncomfortable questions about the value of Washington’s role. But America matters by dint of its economic and military strength, and its major role in many alliances. I turned to some informed observers for their reflections on the global consequences of this very consequential election.“I cannot sugarcoat these warnings,” says Rose Gottemoeller, Nato’s former deputy secretary general. “Donald Trump is Europe’s nightmare, with echoes of his threat to withdraw from Nato in everyone’s ears.”Washington’s defence spending amounts to two-thirds of the military budgets of Nato’s 31 other members. Beyond Nato, the US spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia.Trump boasts he’s playing hardball to force other Nato countries to meet their spending targets, which is 2% of their GDP - only 23 of the member nations have hit this target in 2024. But his erratic statements still jar.If Harris wins, Ms Gottemoeller believes “Nato will no doubt be in good Washington hands.” But she has a warning there too. “She will be ready to continue working with Nato and the European Union to achieve victory in Ukraine, but she will not back off on [spending] pressure on Europe.”But Harris’s team in the White House will have to govern with the Senate or the House, which could both soon be in Republican hands, and will be less inclined to back foreign wars than their Democratic counterparts. There’s a growing sense that no matter who becomes president, pressure will mount on Kyiv to find ways out of this war as US lawmakers become increasingly reluctant to pass huge aid packages.Whatever happens, Ms Gottemoeller says, “I do not believe that Nato must fall apart.” Europe will need to “step forward to lead.”The next US president will have to work in a world confronting its greatest risk of major power confrontation since the Cold War.“The US remains the most consequential international actor in matters of peace and security”, Comfort Ero, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, tells me. She adds a caveat, “but its power to help resolve conflicts is diminished.”Wars are becoming ever harder to end. “Deadly conflict is becoming more intractable, with big-power competition accelerating and middle powers on the rise,” is how Ms Ero describes the landscape. Wars like Ukraine pull in multiple powers, and conflagrations such as Sudan pit regional players with competing interests against each other, and some more invested in war than in peace.America is losing the moral high ground, Ms Ero says. “Global actors notice that it applies one standard to Russia's actions in Ukraine, and another to Israel's in Gaza. The war in Sudan has seen terrible atrocities but gets treated as a second-tier issue.”A win by Harris, she says, “represents continuity with the current administration.” If it’s Trump, he “might give Israel an even freer hand in Gaza and elsewhere, and has intimated he could try to cut a Ukraine deal with Moscow over Kyiv’s head.”On the Middle East, the Democratic candidate has repeatedly echoed Mr Biden’s firm backing of Israel’s “right to defend itself.” But she’s also made a point of emphasising that “the killing of innocent Palestinians has to stop.”Trump has also declared it’s time to “get back to peace and stop killing people.” But he’s reportedly told the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what you have to do.”The Republican contender prides himself on being a peacemaker. “I will have peace in the Middle East, and soon,” he vowed in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya TV on Sunday night.He’s promised to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords. These bilateral agreements normalised relations between Israel and a few Arab states, but were widely seen to have sidelined the Palestinians and ultimately contributed to the current unprecedented crisis.On Ukraine, Trump never hides his admiration for strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He’s made it clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine, and with it the US’s hefty military and financial support. “I’ll get out. We gotta get out,” he insisted in a recent rally.In contrast, Harris has said: “I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine. And I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war.”But Ms Ero worries that, no matter who’s elected, things could get worse in the world.“The biggest shock to the global economy for decades.” That’s the view of leading China scholar Rana Mitter regarding Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariffs on all imported Chinese goods.Imposing steep costs on China, and many other trading partners, has been one of Trump’s most persistent threats in his “America first” approach. But Trump also lauds what he sees as his own strong personal connection with President Xi Jinping. He told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board he wouldn’t have to use military force if Beijing moved to blockade Taiwan because the Chinese leader “respects me and he knows I’m [expletive] crazy.”But both leading Republicans and Democrats are hawkish. Both see Beijing as being bent on trying to eclipse America as the most consequential power.But Mr Mitter, a British historian who holds the ST Lee Chair in US-Asia relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School, sees some differences. With Ms Harris he says, “relations would likely develop in a linear fashion from where they are now.” If Trump wins, it’s a more “fluid scenario.” For example, on Taiwan, Mr Mitter points to Trump’s ambivalence about whether he would come to the defence of an island far from America.China’s leaders believe both Harris and Trump will be tough. Mr Mitter sees it as “a small group of establishment types favour Harris as ‘better the opponent you know.’ A significant minority see Trump as a businessman whose unpredictability might just mean a grand bargain with China, however unlikely that seems.”America and... the Middle EastThe latest episode of the Global Story looks at what a Trump or Harris presidency could mean for violence in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding region.Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside the UK, listen wherever you get your podcasts.“The US election is hugely consequential not just for its citizens but for the whole world because of the pressing imperative of the climate and nature crisis,” says Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.“Every fraction of a degree matters to avert the worst impacts of climate change and prevent a future where devastating hurricanes like Milton are the norm,” she added.But as Hurricanes Milton and Helene raged, Trump derided environmental plans and policies to confront this climate emergency as “one of the greatest scams of all time.” Many expect him to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement as he did in his first term.However, Ms Robinson believes Trump cannot stop the momentum now gathering steam. “He cannot halt the US energy transition and roll back the billions of dollars in green subsidies... nor can he stop the indefatigable non-federal climate movement.”She also urged Harris, who still hasn’t fleshed out her own stance, to step up “to show leadership, build on the momentum of recent years, and spur other major emitters to pick up the pace.”“The outcome of the US election holds immense significance, given the unparalleled influence the United States wields, not just through its military and economic might, but through its potential to lead with moral authority on the global stage,” says Martin Griffiths, a veteran conflict mediator, who, until recently, was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.He sees greater light if Harris wins, and says that “a return to Trump’s presidency marked by isolationism and unilateralism, offers little but a deepening of global instability.”But he has criticism, too, for the Biden-Harris administration, citing its “hesitancy” over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.Aid agency bosses have repeatedly condemned Hamas’s murderous October 7th assault on Israeli civilians. But they’ve also repeatedly called on the US to do much more to end the profound suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as in Lebanon.Biden and his top officials continually called for more aid to flow into Gaza, and did make a difference at times. But critics say the aid, and the pressure, was never enough. A recent warning that some vital military assistance could be cut pushed the decision until after the US elections.The US is the single largest donor when it comes to the UN system. In 2022, it provided a record $18.1bn (£13.9bn).But in Trump’s first term, he axed funding for several UN agencies and pulled out of the World Health Organisation. Other donors scrambled to fill the gaps – which is what Trump wanted to happen.But Griffths still believes America is an indispensable power.“In a time of global conflict and uncertainty, the world longs for the US to rise to the challenge of responsible, principled leadership... We demand more. We deserve more. And we dare to hope for more.”BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

CONTENT: Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president - after a decisive victory that will send him back to the White House.His defeated opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, urged her supporters to accept Trump's win, and insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power.He will be the first former president to return to office in more than 130 years, and - at 78 - the oldest man ever elected to the role.Trump has already been congratulated by world leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the UK's Keir Starmer, but the official presidential election results are not yet confirmed.There had been fears that extremely close races in some of the key battleground "swing" states might have left the results uncertain.But earlier-than-expected wins in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, coupled with victories in solidly Republican states, meant Trump reached the magic 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.CBS, the BBC's broadcasting partner in the US, projected Donald Trump as the overall winner just after 05:30 EST (10:30 GMT) on 6 November, the day after the election.However, it could still take days or even weeks for the detailed election results to be confirmed officially in every state.No. Trump becomes the president-elect, and his running mate JD Vance becomes the vice-president elect.Trump will be sworn in at the presidential inauguration on Monday, 20 January 2025, at which point he legally assumes the power and responsibilities of the presidency.After winning the 2016 election. Trump was sworn in as president in January 2017 and served until 2021.Once every valid vote has been included in the final results, a process known as the electoral college confirms the election result.In each state a varying number of electoral college votes are up for grabs. It is securing these – and not the backing of voters themselves – that ultimately wins the presidency.Generally, states award all of their electoral college votes to whoever wins the popular vote, and this is confirmed after meetings on 17 December.The new US Congress then meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president. As the outgoing vice-president, Kamala Harris will preside over this process.It was this meeting of Congress, to certify the election results, that Trump's supporters tried to stop, when they marched on the US Capitol in 2021 after Trump refused to concede defeat to Joe Biden.Trump and Vance will work with their transition team to organise the handover from President Biden’s outgoing administration.They will identify their policy priorities, start vetting the candidates who will take up key roles in the new administration, and prepare to take over the functions of government.At his victory rally, Trump hinted that the former Republican presidential candidate and vaccine sceptic Robert J Kennedy could be given a healthcare role.Tech billionaire Elon Musk is also expected to feature in the new administration. Trump previously said he would ask Mr Musk to tackle government waste.Trump and his team will also begin receiving classified national security briefings covering current threats and ongoing military operations.The president-elect and vice-president-elect also receive mandatory protection from the US Secret Service.Trump's team says he has accepted a traditional invitation from Biden to visit the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the administrations.The outgoing president also typically attends the inauguration of the incoming president, although Trump chose to boycott the 2021 event.Trump did, however, follow the tradition begun by Ronald Reagan of leaving a handwritten note in the Oval Office for his successor to read.At the time, President Biden told reporters that his predecessor had left "a very generous letter”.After the inauguration, the new president begins work immediately.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: In the build-up to Tuesday’s US election, claims of voter fraud flooded social media - but as Donald Trump’s victory crystallised, the chatter largely subsided.The claims didn’t stop entirely, however. A number of right-wing influencers and organisations pushing stories about “cheating” and a “rigged” vote pointed to incomplete vote totals and continued to repeat discredited theories about the 2020 election.And disappointed Democratic Party supporters developed their own unsubstantiated voter fraud theories, some of which went viral on X, formerly Twitter, and other platforms.The reach of the posts is nowhere near the deluge of content that circulated after Trump lost the 2020 election.And with no support from losing candidate Kamala Harris or other Democratic Party officials, the chances seem slim of a large-scale movement developing along the lines of the “Stop the Steal” drive four years ago, which culminated in a riot at the US Capitol.The BBC tracked a huge wave of pre-election fraud claims that carried through election day and into the evening.These included claims of the vote being “stolen” in some key swing states, with exaggerated takes on real events being used in some cases to bolster the allegations.Early on election day in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold, there were problems with voting machines malfunctioning. The issues were fixed and voting hours in the affected areas were extended.However, many online immediately used the story to suggest nefarious activities were taking place.One post at 08:45 local time on Tuesday said: “The election steal is happening!”Other rumours were spread in posts that popped up throughout the day, including one at around 14:00, which claimed ballots in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, had been pre-marked for Kamala Harris.In Milwaukee, the biggest city in the swing state of Wisconsin, elections officials made a decision to re-run around 30,000 ballots out of an “abundance of caution”, after doors on the back of voting machines were left open.Once the count was completed, it showed that support for Harris had dropped compared with Joe Biden's four years earlier.Like many of the pro-Trump posters, Harris supporters pointed to real but isolated events - fires at ballot drop boxes in Washington and Oregon, and a series of fake bomb threats that disrupted voting at several polling locations on election day - as evidence of widespread voter fraud.However, there’s no evidence that the incidents significantly altered the vote or changed the outcome.Several posts from Democratic Party activists questioning the result went viral and were seen by millions on X and other platforms.Pam Keith, a Harris supporter in Florida, posted: “Is it possible that the machines were hacked to switch the tallies from Harris to Trump?” Her message was seen more than one million times on X, according to the site’s metrics. The BBC has reached out to her for comment.Unlike Trump’s campaign in 2020, however, the Harris campaign and top Democratic Party officials have not endorsed allegations of cheating or voter fraud.On election day, fraud rumours also came from President-elect Trump himself, who has repeatedly argued from the outset of his political career that the voting system is unfairly stacked against him.Just after 16:30 Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!”The now president-elect did not give any details and the Philadelphia Police Department told BBC Verify they were not aware of what Trump was referring to.Seth Bluestein, the Republican City Commissioner in Philadelphia, posted on X: "There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure."Trump has not repeated the fraud allegations since election day.We have contacted several hugely influential accounts that regularly posted about election fraud claims in the build-up to the vote, but none of them replied.With data firm NodeXL, the BBC tracked accounts that engaged with Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Elon Musk on X around election day.Posts mentioning vote fraud peaked at 15:00 EST on 5 November - but then dropped off significantly that evening and into the next day as polls closed and results came in.However, some organisations and activists who promoted voter fraud allegations in the past continued to repeat debunked rumours even after the results became clear.Emerald Robinson, a former reporter with right-wing TV networks and a pro-Trump influencer with more than 750,000 followers on X, insisted that Democrats were “cheating right now” and posted: “I always told people the voting machines were rigged!”More generally, reaction from pro-Trump groups and influencers who previously hyped up vote fraud claims varied - from silence on the issue, to continued insistence that the 2020 vote was marred by fraud.The BBC contacted Ms Robinson for comment.In another case, a chart that was widely circulating online claimed to show a sharp drop-off in vote totals in 2024 compared to 2020.Many are pointing to the figures as “proof” of fraud.Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, a Trump supporter who has pushed voter fraud theories, posted the day after the election: "Kamala got 60 million votes in 2024. Does anyone really believe Biden got 80 million in 2020? Where did those 20 million Democratic voters go? The truth is, they never existed."However, the chart and the figures circulating online were based on preliminary vote totals, which continue to go up as final results are still being tabulated.Already, Harris has more than 69 million votes in her column - with Trump on more than 73 million. As of Friday, fewer than two million ballots have yet to be counted nationally, in states including Arizona and California, according to Reuters.The BBC contacted Mr D'Souza for comment.Those same numbers are also fuelling conspiracy theories from supporters of Harris, who are wondering where their “missing” voters are - and ignoring the fact that turnouts and preferences frequently shift, often dramatically, between elections.Partisans on both sides are also pointing to differences in vote tallies for Harris and other Democrats running for Senate seats.But there is no requirement for US voters to support candidates from just one party, and “ticket-splitting” - voting for candidates from different parties in different races - although becoming rarer, is fairly common in American politics.The University of Florida’s Election Lab turnout tracker is showing slightly lower turnout in 2024 as compared to 2020 - 62.5% v just over 66%.Additional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh and Merlyn ThomasWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Hollywood actress Eva Longoria has revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain.In an interview with French magazine Marie Claire for its November cover story, Longoria attributed the decision to the country's "changing vibe" after the Covid-19 pandemic, homelessness and high taxation in California, and the re-election of Donald Trump.She also acknowledged she was "privileged" enough to move, saying: “Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country."The Desperate Housewives star is viewed as a power broker for women and Latinos in Democratic Party politics.With a keen interest in immigration policy, she has been visibly involved with Democratic candidates at the national and local level since at least 2012.She spoke at the Democratic National Convention and hit the campaign trail on behalf of Kamala Harris this year, with a tagline for the 2024 presidential candidate that adopted the "Si se puede" slogan ("Yes it's possible" in Spanish) from 1970s Latino-led farm-worker protests into the phrase "She se puede".In her Marie Claire interview, published on Thursday, Longoria described being dispirited at Trump's victory over Harris last week.“If he keeps his promises, it’s going to be a scary place," she said.She added that Trump's win in 2016 had crushed her belief that "the best person wins" in politics.“I had my whole adult life here,” Longoria said of Los Angeles, adding that “it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now”.Longoria is a ninth-generation Texan who moved to California in her twenties. In 2006, she earned a Golden Globe nomination in her starring role as Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives.More recently, she has hosted the CNN mini-series Searching for Mexico and Searching for Spain.She is married to José "Pepe" Bastón, her third husband and the president of Mexican broadcaster Televisa.The couple share a six-year-old boy, Santiago, while Bastón also has three children from a previous marriage.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: The 2024 presidential election is the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which protected the national right to an abortion.The gender divide has been prominent in this election, with polls suggesting Kamala Harris has an advantage among women and former President Donald Trump is enjoying a similar lead among men.The BBC has been speaking to women voters about how they are considering gender and abortion as they cast their ballots in the final days of the campaign.Michelle works as a quality engineer in Arizona. The 38-year-old is a registered Republican, but plans on voting for Kamala Harris.I'm concerned about women's rights and women's health care. I'm not a one-issue voter, but that is a huge one. I work in the medical sector and I was very personally affected by the overturn of Roe v Wade because I wasn't able to get access to a lot of the drugs I needed. Nobody was sure of what the legality was... even though they're used for other things.The whole Republican stance is smaller government and don't let government make my personal decisions, so why are they trying to legislate what a woman can do with her body?[A Harris presidency] would mean that all the things that my parents told me when I was younger were true - that just because you're a girl doesn't mean that you are limited.This nurse practitioner from Texas voted for Trump during the last presidential election and plans to back him again.[Trump] has definitely said things that he probably should have unsaid. I would have to shake my finger at that, especially as a woman, but I have yet to hear anything that would make me change my mind about my vote.I'm not voting personality. I'm voting policy. I don't have to marry the man. I don't have to deal with him. I have to deal with his policies.On abortion, [Harris] is not giving a gestational parameter of how late somebody can get an abortion. That cannot be-open ended. I was a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] nurse for 17 years... I care about women's rights. I care about women. The mother is the first patient. However, that is the turn-off to me that she won't give an answer to that.This Democrat from Illinois plans to vote for Harris on election day. She previously backed the Democratic ticket in 2020, voting for Joe Biden.I am definitely concerned about the direction that reproductive rights are going in parts of the country. I feel that Trump's attempts to communicate that he understands why [reproductive rights] is an important issue to women has fallen woefully short.I think Harris has an innate understanding of its importance, just being a woman and a woman of colour. Would I like her to lay out her plans a little bit more to potentially expand reproductive rights? Absolutely. But Trump has set the bar so low that she could really continue to not even mention it and she would still be doing a better job.[A Harris presidency] brings tears to my eyes just to think about. I have a nine-year-old daughter and she's old enough to start having aspirations and to start paying attention to the world around her.This library assistant voted for Trump in 2020, but now remains undecided and is considering "writing in" a candidate - casting a vote for someone who is not officially running.This ain't my first rodeo and I've gotten to the point in my life where I can look past the advertising they're doing for two specific groups.It's wonderful that we have Harris as a female seriously running for the presidency and that she has been a vice-president and has some experience. But Trump, when he was in office, I wasn't too upset with what he was doing.I wouldn't mind having a female president but some of Harris's political doctrine and what I think is right don't line up.Angela is a graduate student in Iowa. A Democrat, she backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris.I really would love this to be a moment of celebration as we elect a woman of colour to our highest office, but unfortunately with how tight the election is against Trump and how disappointing [Harris's] campaign has been on some of the issues that matter to me, it's been hard to be as celebratory as I'd like.Obviously abortion is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm not necessarily happy, I should say, with either candidate's approaches in addressing the issue.I understand Harris has a policy where she wants to codify Roe v Wade, but I think women's rights and issues extend outside of just abortion access. Trump is very wishy-washy on the issue of women's rights, so it's hard to pin him down on any stance.This retired Republican who plans on voting for Trump. She also backed the former president in 2020.I think [Trump] is really the only possibility because I think Harris is just clueless and incompetent. I think she would be a disaster for this country, just listening to her mumble and evade. I just get a horrible feeling about her.I am pro-choice, actually, within reason. Not a late-term abortion. I don't agree with that. But I think Trump by really relegating [legislation] to the states themselves, he's being sensible.Harris doesn't have much to run on so that's her big selling point with women. She doesn't have much substance to her, in other words, so she just hammers on and on about the abortion issue.This independent voted for Biden in the 2020 presidential election and voted by mail this year supporting Harris.Reproductive rights for women are huge for me as a woman, especially living in the state of Florida where there is an amendment on the ballot that will guarantee the protection for abortion rights.I really want to support a party that's going to support reproductive rights for women and not just women, but for everybody, because what's to say it's not going to spread elsewhere? It starts with women, usually, but it goes on and on.Our government is at least 50 years behind the times for a lot of things - especially other countries throughout the world having better representation. I have a niece that I love dearly. The fact that she could see [a female president], and just for that to be a normal thing for her, will be huge.This independent voter from Georgia describes herself as a left-leaning moderate. Because of her faith and anti-abortion views, she's not supporting Harris or Trump this year.I was actually going to vote for Harris, but then she started doubling down on how abortion is reproductive health... I'm a Catholic. I am pro-life.The problem that I ran into is that I don't know how any Catholic can vote for somebody who spews the stuff like what we saw [from Trump] at Madison Square Garden recently. I take the injunction to welcome the stranger and to feed and clothe very seriously.So under those circumstances, I've got nobody I can vote for.This retired Texas resident voted for Biden in the last presidential election and has voted early in support of Harris.I get so scared. We actually can't go back. It's very frightening to me. I had more rights than my granddaughter is going to have in her future and that's not right.It is so disturbing that it is so close. [Trump] is a felon out on bail. I don't understand the Republicans. They used to be the law and order [party], supposedly, and it's now this.I think a lot [of women] are coming out and saying, 'Why are you telling us what to do with our bodies?' Abortion is a personal thing and it's up to the doctor and the woman. It is none of my business.In the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Americans around the country about what matters to them.Are you an American voter? Want to join in?

CONTENT: The night before Kamala Harris sets off on a final multi-day swing through the key battleground states that will decide the 2024 presidential election, she gave one last speech, practically in the shadow of the White House.The venue choice was no accident. Donald Trump held his rally on 6 January 2021 in the same place, speaking to supporters just hours before thousands of them stormed the Capitol and disrupted certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.On a mild October night, Harris stood before what her campaign estimated was 70,000 cheering supporters at an event they may hope is a counterpoint to that cold, violent January day.And in the unlikely chance the symbolism was missed by anyone watching, Harris made it explicit early in her speech.“We know who Donald Trump is,” she said on Tuesday. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”Harris didn’t dwell on the 6 January riot, however. The venue did most of the heavy lifting, providing the subtext to the speech and the point from which Harris could pivot.While she opened by darkly warning of an “unstable” and “unhinged” Trump “obsessed with revenge”, she turned to focus on what she called her “different path”.Acknowledging that many undecided American voters “are still getting to know” her after her abbreviated presidential campaign, Harris touched on the highlights of her biography and upbringing.She went on to hit some of her top policy proposals, including lowering the cost of housing, expanding the child tax credit and adding homecare coverage to government-provided health insurance for the elderly.She spent even more time talking about abortion and the need to enact legislation that provides national abortion rights – a particularly strong area for Democrats over Republican opponents.It was, in effect, a trimmed-down version of her Democratic National Convention address – a bookend to the late August speech that the campaign billed as an introduction to Americans.Democrats were riding high back then, enthusiastic about their new nominee after weeks of despondency and infighting that led to Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid.Since then, Harris’s campaign has had ups and downs, and is now locked in what is shaping up to be a photo finish next week.If the polls are accurate, Harris still has work to be done to win over undecided Americans – and this speech was her last, biggest effort to do so on a prominent stage, with the White House looming over her shoulder.Setting aside her biographical highlights and policy details, the message her campaign seems to want voters to have in mind on election day is one of contrasts – of division versus unity; bitterness versus hope; partisanship versus co-operation; past versus future.“I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better,” Harris said. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”As she was delivering her speech, however, the current resident of the building behind her made comments that illustrated how difficult her task might be.Biden, speaking of a derisive joke about Puerto Rico that a comedian made at a Trump rally on Sunday, appeared to refer to Trump supporters as “garbage”.The president later claimed he was referring only to the comments made by the rally speaker. But the video of his remarks are unclear – and the episode was already distracting from Harris’ event on Tuesday evening.It’s just one more obstacle Harris will have to overcome, along with assuaging Americans' concerns about the economy and immigration - where polls indicate Trump has the advantage.She tried to address those in her speech as well, even if they seemed to take a back seat to more lofty language and pointed attacks.Her speech framed the election in a way that is to her advantage.

CONTENT: Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about "illegal aliens" voting in this election.He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been "importing" immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.But voting and immigration experts we have spoken to have challenged this, pointing out that it is illegal for them to vote in federal elections and that even if some might qualify for citizenship eventually, the process would take many years.Mr Musk has engaged with posts on X which suggest that illegal immigrants are already voting in this election.On 30 October, he responded to a claim that illegal voters were able to apply for mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.Mr Musk replied to the claim, which has been rejected by local election officials, saying: "Is this real?"It is against the law for non-citizens to vote in US federal elections - punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation.A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of non-citizens having voted in US federal elections are very small.Since July, Mr Musk has posted at least 22 times about voters being "imported" from abroad.The language in many of these posts is ambiguous as to whether he means this will impact this election or future ones.In seven posts, he has said they are going directly into swing states.On 20 October, in a post viewed 21 million times, he said: “Triple digit increases of illegals in swing states over the past 4 years. Voter importation at an unprecedented scale!”Along with the post, he shared a table that showed very large percentage increases in "unauthorized migrants" in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, since 2021.The table, which does not have a source, had been posted by "America" - a political action committee Mr Musk set up to support Trump.We could not find evidence for these figures but migration experts pointed us towards the latest Department of Homeland Security report which has estimates for each state between 2018 to 2022.These show that in several states - including Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina - the number of "unauthorised immigrants" has remained steady or dropped over this period.They do show large numbers living in these states under the Biden administration but also when Trump was president.Mr Musk has repeatedly suggested that illegal immigrants will gain citizenship and sway future elections for the Democrats.In a post on 25 October, which got almost 17 million views, he said: “Their stated plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem. America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.”Voting and immigration experts described this as a far-fetched claim.Democrats have expressed a desire for some undocumented migrants in the US to have "an earned pathway" to citizenship, but it is not their stated policy to grant them all this."Some undocumented migrants who arrive in the US could have a route to citizenship - but that would typically take a decade or longer, if they even have a path at all, which many of them will not," says Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute.In several posts, Mr Musk mentions a 1986 bill which granted amnesty to approximately three million undocumented immigrants in the US.This was passed by Congress and signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan. It forgave individuals who came into the US illegally but did not give them immediate citizenship.“Perhaps Musk imagines that a president or administration can simply decree mass naturalisation of noncitizens without going through the prescribed individual legal processes, and that Congress and the courts would simply then accept this. That's not how it works", Walter Olson, a voting rights expert from the conservative think tank, the Cato Institute told us.On 25 October, Mr Musk posted on X: “Massive numbers flown directly to swing states and put on the fast track to citizenship. Voter importation.”The post, viewed almost 19 million times, included a chart entitled “inadmissible aliens” shared by Mario Nawfal.Mr Nawfal has been community noted (the process on X which crowdsources fact-checking from users) several times for making unverified claims.He is one of the people Mr Musk has interacted with most on X over the last few months, according to Node XL.It is unclear where the figure of 823,000 “inadmissible aliens” comes from.The chart refers to @fentasyl - the anonymous X account of a "data expert" - but does not have a source.It shows a large increase in migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti entering the US from 2023 onwards.This appears to be a reference to the Humanitarian Parole Scheme launched in January 2023. This scheme allows vetted migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to live and work in the US legally - if they have a US sponsor.Big numbers have arrived under this scheme - 531,000 people up until the end of September 2024.But they are not allowed to vote and are not put on “a fast track to citizenship”.They are permitted to stay in the US for a maximum of two years.Some may be able to apply for protected status which would allow their temporary stay to be extended. But, even if they got this, they would not be able to vote in a federal election.Those who do not qualify have to leave the country or face deportation proceedings.“There is no direct path to a green card for people entering the US from Nicaragua, Venezuelan or Haiti on the Humanitarian Parole Scheme,” says Ms Mittelstadt.“They could apply for asylum but these claims can take years, and if granted it doesn’t give you the right to vote,” she adds.To become a US citizen - and get the right to vote in a federal election - you have to go through naturalisation.To apply, someone has to have been a lawful permanent resident for five years; married to a US citizen and a lawful permanent resident for three years; or be a member of the military.As of August 2024, 3.3 million immigrants had become naturalised citizens under the Biden administration.Under Trump, the figure was around three million people.It is also worth noting that new citizens are not guaranteed Democratic voters.According to a recent survey, 54 percent of naturalised citizens said they would vote for Harris in November, while 38 percent said they would vote for Trump.We have asked X for comment and to provide further evidence for Mr Musk’s claims.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Luke GarrettRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27 in New York City.An election betting advertisement flashed on screen during coverage of former President Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden this weekend on the Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media company."Bet on the US election," the ad for Kalshi said as Trump spoke on stage. "Bet $100 on Trump, Get $175."More than $100 million has been legally wagered on the presidential race on the platform, days out from Election Day. This explosion in legal betting comes after a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed KalshiEX LLC, an online-betting company, to open an election prediction market.The company's CEO, Tarek Mansour, told NPR his election market — which shows a 63% chance of Trump winning as of Tuesday — is a "mechanism for truth" and help regular people hedge against unpredictable political risk. But critics like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have called the legal decision a "huge mistake" that harms American democracy.Kalshi is still battling federal regulators in court. But retail investing platform Robinhood also started offering bets on election contracts this week. That leaves Americans free to make tens of millions of legal election bets, with little known about how they will impact one of the closest and most contentious presidential elections in decades.Wagering on the U.S. presidential election is nothing new. Bets on presidential candidates were common during the turn of the 20th century. Betting commissioners in New York City controlled these markets at a place called the New York Curb Exchange.Not only did bets occur, the markets were fairly accurate during a time before scientific political polls, according to NPR's former gambling correspondent and current editor Keith Romer."Of the 15 presidential elections between 1884 and 1940, the betting market correctly calls the race in 11," Romer told NPR's Planet Money. "It's too close to call in three. And they only get one wrong."Major papers, like The New York Times, would publish the betting odds as a source of information, Romer said. But in the latter half of the 20th century, during the advent of scientific polling and a number of prohibitive gambling laws, election betting fell out of favor.In recent years, prediction markets have brought election betting back. On the social media platform X, the Trump campaign, tech billionaire Elon Musk and pollster Nate Silver often post the latest presidential betting odds on Polymarket, an offshore prediction market U.S. citizens can only use illegally.To date, $2.5 billion has been bet on the presidential election on Polymarket, which also gives the former president a 66% chance of election victory. Suspicious activity has raised questions about the site's accuracy: Blockchain researchers cited by Fortune say there's evidence some one-third of the volume on Polymarket's presidential betting market is artificial.Kalshi for the first time gives Americans a legal platform for their wagers, which CEO and co-founder Mansour argued offers voters accurate information, in contrast to political polling.Rajiv Sethi, a professor of economics at Barnard College who has been studying these markets for years, said the "jury is still out" on whether prediction markets are better than traditional political polling — but it's close."They generate outputs that are actually quite competitive with the best models," Sethi said.Mansour, the CEO, said the goal is to broaden election betting to the general public, similar to the creative financial vehicles that are available to hedge risks for "high-net-worth individuals" at investment banks like Goldman Sachs, his former employer.He gave the example of an environmental company protecting itself against the election of a candidate who proposes slashing climate change initiatives."People can now do something about it," Mansour said. "They can reduce their exposure and volatility towards events that they don't really have control over."When asked about nefarious betting meant to falsely inflate the odds of a given candidate, Mansour said election markets are "self-correcting" because bettors will see an opportunity to make money on an inflated outcome."The only outcome is basically — the people who tried to manipulate in the first place lost a lot of money," Mansour said during an interview conducted when the Kalshi odds mirrored those of public polls.Mansour admitted election betting isn't a zero-risk proposition, but said Kalshi is federally regulated — meaning regulators would be able to intervene if someone tried to manipulate a market."Everything is super transparent and everyone can see anything you do and know your name and your address and what you're doing and the government is monitoring," Mansour said. "It feels like a pretty bad place to try to do any of these things."Sethi, the Barnard professor, largely agreed, citing a 2012 case when an anonymous person bet $7 million to increase the odds of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney winning the election, and failed when other gamblers caught on. But Sethi said there still is a potential for manipulation."Your belief about whether a candidate is viable, is doing well, is likely to prevail, can affect things like fundraising, support, the enthusiasm, volunteer effort and so on," Sethi said. "These things can actually affect the actual outcome of the election."Supporters of Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Harris wait on The Ellipse just south of the White House for her speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. More than $100 million have been legally wagered on the presidential race on the first legal election betting platform in the U.S. in years.One week from Election Day, the Kalshi market favors Trump by over 30 percentage points — while most political polls show Harris and Trump statistically tied. This misalignment has raised questions about the accuracy of these markets.Merkley, the Oregon senator, has opposed Kalshi from the start and proposed a bill in Congress to ban all election betting."Allowing election betting is a huge mistake," Merkley told NPR. "It turns elections from a place where you exercise your principles to where you exercise your pocketbook. It corrupts our American elections."Beyond the moral challenge, Merkley said the law prohibits it. He says it's against Regulation 40.11 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which prohibits trades on "terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law." The CFTC is fighting Kalshi in court."Gaming is betting on the outcome of a contest," Merkley said. "An election is a contest. These are not commodities. This is not oil. This is not silver."Kalshi's Mansour said he knows election betting comes with a stigma of corruption, but argued the critique doesn't hold water."We fought for these markets not because we think they threaten election integrity," Mansour said. "On the contrary, we think they promote it."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, having promised action on issues including immigration, the economy and the war in Ukraine.He looks likely to enjoy plenty of support for his political agenda in Congress after his Republican Party regained control of the Senate.In his victory speech, Trump vowed he would "govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept. We're going to keep our promises".But in some cases, he has given little detail of how he might achieve his aims.Asked in 2023 by Fox News whether he would abuse his power or target political opponents, he replied he would not, "except for day one"."No, no, no, other than day one. We're closing the border, and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I'm not a dictator."While campaigning, Trump promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history.He also pledged to complete the building of a wall at the border with Mexico that was started during his first presidency.The number of crossings at the US southern border hit record levels at the end of last year during the Biden-Harris administration, before falling in 2024.Experts have told the BBC that deportations on the scale promised by Trump would face huge legal and logistical challenges - and could slow economic growth.Exit poll data has suggested the economy was a key issue for voters. Trump has promised to "end inflation" - which rose to high levels under President Joe Biden before falling again. But a president's power to directly influence prices is limited.He has also promised sweeping tax cuts, extending his overhaul from 2017. He has proposed making tips tax-free, abolishing tax on social security payments and shaving corporation tax.He has proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said. Some economists have warned that such moves could push up prices for ordinary people.During his first presidency, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections and made America the first nation to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.This time, he has again vowed to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden's targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars.He has pledged to increase production of US fossil fuels - vowing to "drill, drill, drill" on day one in favour of renewable energy sources such as wind power.He wants to open areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs - though analysts are sceptical.Trump has criticised the tens of billions of dollars spent by the US on supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia - and has pledged to end the conflict "within 24 hours" through a negotiated deal.He has not said what he thinks either side should give up. Democrats say the move would embolden President Vladimir Putin.Trump wants the US to disentangle itself from foreign conflicts generally. Regarding the war in Gaza - Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, but has urged the American ally to end its operation.He has also pledged to end the related violence in Lebanon, but gave no detail on how.Against the wishes of some of his supporters, Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris that he would not sign into law a national abortion ban.In 2022, the nationwide constitutional right to abortion was overturned by the Supreme Court, which had a majority of conservative judges following Trump's first presidency.Reproductive rights became a key campaigning topic for Harris, and several states approved measures to protect or expand abortion rights on polling day.Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion, but struggled to find a consistent message of his own.Trump has said he will "free" some of those convicted of offences during the riot in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, when his supporters stormed the Capitol building in an effort to thwart the 2020 election victory of Joe Biden.Several deaths were blamed on the violence, which Trump was accused of inciting.He has worked to downplay the riot's significance and recast the hundreds of supporters who were convicted as political prisoners.He continues to say many of them are "wrongfully imprisoned", though has acknowledged that "a couple of them, probably they got out of control".Trump has vowed to sack "within two seconds" of taking office the veteran prosecutor leading two criminal investigations against him.Special Counsel Jack Smith has indicted Trump over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and over his alleged mishandling of classified documents.Trump denies any wrongdoing, and managed to prevent either case coming to trial before the election. He says Mr Smith has subjected him to a "political witch hunt".Trump will return to the White House as the first ever president with a criminal conviction, having been found guilty in New York of falsifying business records.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: World leaders taking part in the latest annual UN climate meeting in Azerbaijan are hoping to agree action to help rein in rising global temperatures.A key issue under discussion is how to get more cash to poorer countries, to help them curb their planet-warming gases, and to cope with the growing impacts of climate change.The decision to hold the meeting in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, has been criticised because of the country’s ties to gas and oil.The US election victory of Donald Trump - a known climate sceptic - could also prove to be a distraction, and some important leaders are not attending.COP29 is the world's most important meeting on climate change.It is led by the UN, and the 2024 event, the 29th such gathering, runs from 11-22 November.It is being held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a central Asian country located between Russia and Iran.COP stands for “Conference of the Parties”."Parties" refers to the countries that have ratified a treaty called the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).That document was signed back in 1992, by almost 200 countries.The COP is the decision-making body linked to that agreement, and representatives of these countries meet every year to negotiate the best approaches to tackling the root causes of climate change.Between 40,000 and 50,000 delegates are expected to attend COP29. This includes representatives from all UN member states, and the EU. Diplomats, climate scientists, trade union leaders and environmental activists will also take part.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the conference that he wants the UK to have more "ambitious" climate goals.Other attendees include UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.However the leaders of some of the largest economies - and biggest carbon emitters - are notably absent from COP29.US President Joe Biden, China's Xi Jinping and France's Emmanuel Macron are not attending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Schulz and India’s Narendra Modi will also not be there.They are staying away for a range of reasons, but their absence could undermine the event's significance.Leaders who do attend will also have lots of other issues on their minds, including two expensive and difficult wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine, and global financial problems."No world leader is arriving with climate change at the number one spot in their inbox," says Oxford University's Prof Thomas Hale.There’s also an underlying feeling that Azerbaijan doesn’t have the diplomatic or financial clout to secure a significant agreement.Many leaders think progress is more likely at COP30, which will be held in Brazil in November 2025.During COP29 key experts, including former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said the COP process is "no longer fit for purpose".They said: "Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity."A key question this year is money.Under the Paris agreement signed in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C. For that to happen countries need to ramp up their efforts to cut warming gases.As part of the agreement, countries committed to develop a new cash target for developing nations by 2025. This money would be used to help emerging economies cut their carbon and adapt to the worst impacts of rising temperatures.Getting agreement on a new finance target is seen as a critical step in building trust between rich and poor nations as, so far, the track record hasn’t been great.African countries and small island states want to see climate finance in total reach over a $1tn a year by 2030.Up to now countries like China and the Gulf States have been classified as developing economies and been exempt from contributing.According to the EU and other wealthy countries, that must change if the overall amount of cash is to be increased.Governments’ plans for tackling climate change in their own countries could also be a tricky issue. They must update their action plans every five years, with the next deadline falling in February 2025.Some countries will release their strategies at this COP, but if they’re weak and look unlikely to stop global warming rising beyond 1.5C, it could cause problems with countries on the front lines of climate change.It is also not clear whether the fossil fuel agreements passed at the last climate talks are still in place. There were signs at the G20 talks earlier in 2024 that some countries wanted to roll back on promises to move away from burning oil, coal and gas.Major UN talks on protecting nature also collapsed in Colombia in October, after nations failed to agree key goals.Azerbaijan has big plans to expand gas production, by up to a third, over the next decade. Some observers worry that a country with that goal is in charge of a conference that aims to transition away from fossil fuels.These fuels are one of the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.There are also concerns, reported by the BBC, that Azerbaijani officials are using the climate conference to boost investment in the country’s national oil and gas company.Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told the conference that oil and gas are “a gift of god”, and that countries should not be blamed for having them, or selling them on the international market.Shortly afterwards, Mr Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was "absurd".There are also deep reservations about holding the meeting in a country with a poor human rights record, where political opposition isn’t tolerated.The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a "scam", and his victory has been seen by climate experts as a major setback.He won’t actually be at COP29, and the team representing President Biden will push for progress, but they know that anything agreed will not bind the new administration.With Trump's election the US is expected to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and from providing finance.However it’s also possible that Trump’s re-election might drive a new sense of unity among other leaders, even building a coalition who might agree a major step on money for poorer countries.Experts argue that the climate crisis - and the world's collective response to it - will outlast a second Trump term.The warning alarms from the climate could not be stronger.It is now "virtually certain" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.The impacts of warmer oceans have been seen with very powerful hurricanes Helene and Milton slamming into the US in the summer.The devastating flooding that killed at least 200 people in Spain in October was also fuelled by higher sea temperatures in the Mediterranean.“Climate change is a cumulative problem. That means that with every year of delay, there is additional warming that we commit our planet to. Now is the time that we need to take action,” explains Prof Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London.In the short-term, agreements at COP can change how nations build their economies, for example by pushing the development of green power. That can affect where we get our energy from and how much we pay for it in our bills.It can also commit countries to paying large sums of money into funds for poorer countries. In the UK this currently comes from aid budgets paid for by taxpayers, although private financial institutions are expected to contribute significantly.In the long-term, the talks aim to build a safer, cleaner world for everyone and prevent the worst of climate change.Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.Outside the UK?

CONTENT: Donald Trump is a keen golfer and owner of many coursesSporting personalities featured prominently in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump's re-election as the president of the United States, with golfer Bryson DeChambeau and UFC president Dana White making appearances on stage during his victory speech in Florida on Wednesday.It was a reminder of the new president's sporting connections before a second term during which his country will host the football World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028 - with Trump set to be a highly visible presence at both.So, what impact could some of his policies have on the sporting landscape?Trump has promised the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, and to complete the building of a wall along the country's southern border that was started during his first presidency.Such policies are set to heighten diplomatic tensions with Mexico, a fellow co-host of the 2026 World Cup (alongside Canada) and could lead to concerns among fans about travelling between the two countries.During his first term in office, there were fears Trump's immigration policies, including a travel ban for certain countries, could cost the US the right to host the tournament for the second time.Trump recently vowed to reinstate the travel ban that barred people from predominantly Muslim countries. However, he had previously reassured Fifa that fans of qualified teams would be allowed entry into the US, and the governing body's president Gianni Infantino - who is known to be close to Trump - seemed pleased by his return to the White House.The US is of crucial importance to Infantino, as it is also hosting the first edition of his controversial, newly-expanded 32-team Club World Cup in 2025. Intended to generate significant funds, it has struggled to attract commercial and media interest, and has led to legal action from the global players' union.The US will celebrate its 250th birthday during the 2026 World Cup, commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and handing the president even more global spotlight.It will soon become clear whether some of his more divisive and inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants makes some businesses think twice about sponsoring the event for fear of being associated with the president.Infantino (pictured left, with Trump in 2018) congratulated him this week, saying: "We will have a great Fifa World Cup and a great Fifa Club World Cup in the United States of America! Soccer unites the world"How would Trump’s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?Seven things Trump says he will do as presidentTrump has vowed to ban all transgender women from female competition in sports, and has regularly focused on the issue during his election campaign, including in TV adverts that criticised transgender athletes and which were shown during sports broadcasts.He has previously condemned trans-inclusive teams, arguing it threatens women's sports.Trump's rhetoric could please those concerned about the impact of transgender inclusion on fairness and safety in female competition. But with the 2028 Games set to take place in Los Angeles, others fear it could also put him at loggerheads with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has allowed individual sports to choose their own gender eligibility policies.Trump has also mocked Olympic women's boxing champion Imane Khelif, who won gold at Paris 2024 a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests.In Republican party campaign videos in the days before the US election, Trump questioned the fighter's biological sex, using it as an example of how he claimed "speaking the truth" had become "hate speech" under Joe Biden's government.Algerian Khelif and her Olympic association have always said she was born a woman and is a woman.The IOC has condemned the "abuse" Khelif has received, blaming "prejudices and culture wars", saying the fighter is eligible to fight in women's boxing.It will also be interesting to see if plans for the Olympics are affected if there is a repeat of the friction seen in the past between Trump and some Democrat politicians who hold powerful positions in California.There could also be tension with the Paralympic community before LA 2028, with Trump having previously denied accusations he mocked a disabled reporter with a congenital joint condition at a rally in 2015. Three years later he was also rebuked by the International Paralympic Committee for saying the Pyeongchang Paralympics was "hard to watch".IOC says Khelif preparing legal action after new eligibility claimsWhat does science tell us about boxing’s gender row?One of the main themes of the sporting landscape over the past decade has been allegations of 'sportswashing' amid unprecedented investment, hosting and sponsorship by Middle Eastern states.Countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly denied accusations they are using sport to distract from their authoritarian regimes' human rights violations, and have accused Western critics of hypocrisy.Could that argument gain traction after the return to the White House of Trump - a convicted felon described by his rivals as a "fascist" and a threat to democracy?Sports bodies may now face uncomfortable questions about taking their flagship events to a country where the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in 2022 by the Supreme Court, which had a majority of conservative judges following Trump's first presidency.There have also been more than 600 mass shootings in the US for each of the past four years, with Trump supportive of gun rights.During the president's first administration, Amnesty International documented "extensive damage to human rights", adding that protecting them in the US "means ending gun violence and guaranteeing adequate healthcare for all, including abortion".The human rights group has also highlighted that the US had the fifth highest number of executions (24) in the world last year. Saudi Arabia was third highest with 172 executions.Fifa says it is "fully committed" to upholding human rights when staging tournaments. But amid scrutiny of the implications of both Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup and Saudi's unopposed bid to stage the 2034 event, Trump's victory could mean the 2026 tournament now comes under renewed focus too.Two-time US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau (right) was on stage for Donald Trump's victory speechWith the US PGA tour involved in protracted negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) over a potential merger aimed at healing a split in men's professional golf over the breakaway LIV circuit, Rory McIlroy believes Trump could help bring an end to the deadlock.A proposed deal is likely to face opposition from the Department of Justice, which has concerns over a possible breach of anti-competition laws, but Trump has suggested he could end golf's "civil war", which has resulted in many leading stars being banned from the PGA Tour.Trump has praised the lucrative LIV tour, and five of its tournaments have been been held at his courses since its inception in June 2022.He has close ties with Saudi Arabia, and has also played golf with PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who could become tour chairman if the reported £1bn 'peace deal' is approved.Under Trump, Saudi influence over golf looks set to grow.The other sport to feature during Trump's victory speech was UFC, with its president White invited to make his own address on the stage.Having Trump as an ally could benefit the UFC as it continues to face legal challenges to the way it operates. This year TKO Group, which owns the UFC, agreed a £281m settlement with former fighters who claimed the MMA promotion suppressed athletes' abilities to negotiate other promotional options.Vladimir Putin (right) called Donald Trump a "courageous man" when congratulating him on his election victoryTrump has been accused by his opponents of cosying up to President Vladimir Putin. With Russia currently in sporting exile because of its invasion of Ukraine, some are asking whether he could put pressure on bodies such as the IOC to end their ban and readmit Russian competitors.Trump has also vowed to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and if that could be achieved it could lead to Russia's return to the international sporting fold.Trump has also proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said.Such trade barriers and any potential retaliatory tariffs could be unhelpful to sports leagues such as the NBA, which is trying to grow its business globally and is keen on staging games in China again, among other countries.Trump’s protectionist trade policy could be awkward for Fifa, which recently secured Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Hisense as the first official partner for next year's Club World Cup.Could tariffs on imports also make it harder for the IOC to find sponsors for the Olympics?In Trump's first term, sport and politics regularly clashed in the US, with his presidency appearing to spark a new era of intensifying athlete activism.In 2017 he was highly critical of the NFL and players who kneeled during the traditional pre-match national anthem in a protest against racial injustice and police brutality towards African-Americans, a movement started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Trump accused them of a lack of patriotism and clashed with a number of top US sports stars - including NBA legends LeBron James and Stephen Curry, and footballer Megan Rapinoe - with some teams rejecting invitations to the White House in protest at his policies.Basketball coach Steve Kerr emerged as a prominent voice of protest against Trump's suspension of the US refugee programme.In 2020, several top stars - including James - launched a campaign designed to encourage more people from black communities to have their say in the presidential election, which Trump narrowly lost.The 2024 election campaign saw both presidential candidates receive the support of a host of sporting figures. It would be little surprise if US sport is politicised once again, and if more athletes use their platforms to speak out on a host of social issues, now Trump is back in the White House.However, it is also worth noting 95% of the tens of millions of dollars donated by sports team owners in the major US professional leagues in recent years reportedly went to Republican campaigns, candidates and committees
, external
.That suggests those in charge of domestic sport are largely content with Trump, and that it may be the major international sporting events the US is due to stage over the coming years where the biggest impact of his return could be felt.

CONTENT: FROMBy Sam GringlasFulton County election workers process absentee ballots on Nov. 4, in Union City, Ga.ATLANTA — Every county in Georgia has certified the results of the 2024 general election, a notable step after some Republican local election board members earlier this year declined to certify other results.Typically an uncontroversial procedural move, disputes over election certification cropped up in several states in 2020, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump amplified baseless claims of widespread fraud.The 2020 examples led to worries about what would happen following the 2024 election, with Trump again on the ballot, even as election officials and experts maintained that certification is mandatory and legal guardrails would minimize disruptions.But with Trump's win in Georgia and in every swing state across the country this year, claims about widespread election fraud have largely dissipated — as have concerns about certification.Each state has its own deadlines for certification of election results at the local and state levels. Georgia's local deadline is among the earliest.Ahead of the 2024 election, battles over certification were most pronounced in Georgia, where Republicans on the State Election Board approved rules that seemingly allowed local election board members to vote against certifying election results.A judge later invalidated the rules, declaring them "illegal, unconstitutional and void." Georgia law says local election boards must certify election results by 5 p.m. on Nov. 12.But that did not stop some local election board members from pressing the courts to rule they have discretion to vote against certifying the results.One local Republican board member, Julie Adams of Fulton County, continued to push ahead in her own lawsuit, even after a judge ruled her certification duties mandatory, not discretionary.Adams had declined to certify election results on several occasions, saying she had not been able to independently verify the integrity of the results. Following the November election that saw Trump and others win in Georgia, she voted to certify those results, though she expressed reservations. "I think it's absolutely ridiculous to have a court order saying I have to vote yes," Adams said Tuesday.Fulton County election board member Julie Adams, a Republican, is seen at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center on Nov. 5.In Metro Atlanta's most populous counties — DeKalb, Fulton, Cobb and Gwinnett — at least one local Republican board member abstained or voted against certifying results from elections earlier in the year. After the November election, all four boards certified the results unanimously.Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will next complete the state certification before presidential electors meet in December."Election integrity doesn't happen just in the 11th hour, as some fringe activists claimed to try to do this past month. It is planned years in advance," Raffensperger told reporters on Tuesday morning. "I believe every county will be in good shape and have it done."While concerns about irregularities and certification have fallen off, they have not disappeared entirely. Some local board members pressed election officials for clarity about minor discrepancies in the results before voting to certify.A handful of Republicans, like Fulton County board member Michael Heekin, are now calling on the state legislature to empower local election board members with the discretion to vote against certifying results in future elections.And some activists have signaled they will continue to raise concerns about election administration, like criticism of Georgia's voting machines and voter list maintenance. But for local voting officials who were preparing to be in the eye of the storm for weeks on end after voting finished, the relative calm has felt like a seismic shift compared to 2020."It's completely different," said Lisa Tollefson, county clerk for Rock County, Wis. "This time four years ago, I was getting nasty phone calls constantly in my office and we had police protection for a while."Her county board of canvassers met Monday to verify the general election results. At a similar meeting in 2020, there were a dozen or more observers, Tollefson said.This year: "I had one observer," she said. "That's it."Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a clerk in Kent County, Mich., said media attention on the administration of elections also died down almost immediately after Michigan was called for Trump."All eyes were on us, and the second we hit midnight almost, it was like they were going to turn into a pumpkin or something and they were gone," Lyons said. "It's not just that it's less tense, but it just seems less interesting to others."NPR's Miles Parks contributed reporting.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: By Debbie Elliott, Juliana KimThe FBI says it's aware of the offensive and racist text messages being received by Black college and high school students, and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter.Federal authorities on Friday provided an update on the series of racist text messages that were sent to Black college and high school students in the days after the election, which included messages about being "selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation."The FBI said in a statement that members of the Hispanic and LGBTQ communities also reported receiving offensive text messages. "Some recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp," the FBI added. The messages were also reported being sent via email.The FBI did not provide further details on the possible origins of the series of the hateful messages.The agency said it was "evaluating all reported incidents and engaging with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. We are also sharing information with our law enforcement partners and community, academia, and faith leaders."St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones, whose 17-year-old son was one of the recipients of a racist texts, said, "It's sick and it's wrong."Jones added, "This awful message that children around the country have been receiving about turning them into slaves and picking them up in an unmarked brown van."Her father, the student's grandfather, Virvus Jones, posted the message on social media.He says it is no joking matter to hearken back to something as horrible as slavery."I know they may think it's funny, but I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1947 when Jim Crow was legal, so it's not funny to me." he says.Virvus Jones takes note of the timing of the texts, coming immediately after a contentious, and dark, election.He added, "What it says about this country is that there are a lot of people who would like to take us back to some form of slavery or some form of being subservient to white supremacy."The Jones family is reporting the message, which appeared to come from a local phone number, to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department."These are some twisted individuals to target children like this, and I hope that they're they are found and prosecuted," says Mayor Tishaura Jones.Civil rights groups across the country are encouraging people to report the texts to police and the FBI."This is alarming, both because there's no indication who the text is from, but because all the people who received it were young African Americans," says Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center and the SPLC Action Fund.The organization, which monitors hate groups, is trying to track down the origins of the text."We have traced the texts being sent from emails that appear to have some international connection," Huang says.She says they've determined that the list of phone numbers may have been purchased from a company. "And we are trying to determine whether the company is indeed the source of this information and to whom they sold the information to actually make those texts possible."Huang says the SPLC is sharing its findings with federal officials. The FBI says it's aware of the offensive and racist text messages and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter.The Federal Communications Commission announced it was opening an investigation into the messages.Several state attorneys general and campus police departments say they have opened investigations into the source of the disturbing robotexts.A Grand Rapids, Michigan tech firm says an attempt was made to use its bulk texting software to send racist messages. TextSpot CEO Lance Beaudry says an internal AI review flagged the language as problematic and possibly indicating human trafficking or forced labor. Upon getting that alert, the company blocked the messages from going out.Beaudry says a user named Amy Jones signed up for a TextSpot account at 3:52 p.m. on Nov. 6 and tried to send a test message. It read: "You have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Be ready at 12AM November 12 SHARP. Be prepared to be searched down once you enter the plantation. You are in Plantaion group A."Beaudry says the company has reported the incident to local authorities and submitted the information to the FBI, including the IP address in the Philadelphia area where the message originated.He says the company's flagging system typically would pick up phishing or fraud messages, but that it's rare to intercept racist material or hate speech.Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her office had traced the origin of some of the messages to a virtual private network provider in Poland but had not found the original source.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: A former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia.Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a "realistic vision for peace"."And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious," he said. "Crimea is gone."A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza "does not speak for him".Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east.The president-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine.But he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for Ukraine's future from his various advisers.Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and "not the goal of the United States"."When Zelensky says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we've got news for President Zelensky: Crimea is gone," he told the BBC World Service’s Weekend programme."And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you're on your own."The US has never deployed American soldiers to fight in Ukraine, nor has Kyiv requested American troops fight on its behalf. Ukraine has only requested American military aid to arm its own soldiers.Mr Lanza said he had tremendous respect for the Ukrainian people, whose "hearts are made of lions". But he said the US priority was "peace and to stop the killing"."What we're going to say to Ukraine is, you know what you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace. It's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. And let's start having the honest conversation," he said.In response, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn characterised Mr Lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on Ukraine when it was "Putin who wants more war"."Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on," he said."Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes."A spokesperson for Trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office - said Mr Lanza was "a contractor for the campaign", but "does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him".Trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office.An unnamed National Security Council aide who previously served under Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday: "Anyone - no matter how senior in Trump’s circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn’t know what he or she is talking about."They said that the former president "makes his own calls on national security issues" and had done so "many times in the moment".Trump spoke to Zelensky after his election win, with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part in the call.A source in Ukraine's presidential office told the BBC that the "good lengthy conversation" between Zelensky and Trump lasted "about half an hour".“It was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant.”Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe.The prime minister of Estonia told the BBC that if Ukraine backs down from the conflict, "Russia’s appetite will only grow".Kristen Michal told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: "The question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more."For Russia it’s quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that’s not the plan."Last month, Zelensky presented a "victory plan" to the Ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede Ukraine’s territories and sovereignty.During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day”, but never gave further details.A paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia.Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, the paper said, but it should negotiate based on current front lines.Earlier this week, Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and said Trump's claim that he can help end the war in Ukraine "deserves attention at least".Mr Lanza also criticised the support the Biden-Harris administration and European countries have given to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022."The reality on the ground is [that] the European nation states and President Biden did not give Ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for Ukraine to win," he said.Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives approved a $61bn (£49bn) package in military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion.The US has been the biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - between February 2022 and the end of June 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (£41.5bn), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation.Clarification: This article has been amended to reflect that Bryan Lanza stopped working as an adviser to the Trump campaign after the election.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: President-elect Donald Trump is joined on stage with former first lady Melania Trump and son Baron Trump during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida.In the days leading up to election night, news outlets across the country were predicting a historically close race, one that could take days to call.

But as election night progressed, it became clear former President Donald Trump was on a path to victory. So much so, that before anything was official, he thanked his supporters from his campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach.

And then, Wednesday morning at about 5:30 it became official when the Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump. We're still awaiting final tallies, but it appears Trump is on track to win the popular vote for the first time.

Trump's agenda for a second term will be dissected over and over in the days ahead. Today, we break down how America sent him back to office---how Trump won in 2024.

CONTENT: Donald John Trump was born on 14 June 1946 in the New York borough of Queens.The fourth of five children, he had two brothers - Fred Jr and Robert - and two sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth. Elizabeth is his only living sibling.His father Fred ran a successful construction company in the outer boroughs of New York. He first joined his business in 1968, but soon struck out on his own in the heart of Manhattan.Casinos, condominiums, golf courses and hotels followed, from Atlantic City, Chicago and Las Vegas to India, Turkey and the Philippines.Donald Trump's flamboyant style helped him stand out in New York's business world and rise to stardom in the entertainment world with the TV show, The Apprentice.Trump has married three times and has five children. He first tied the knot in 1977 with Ivana Zelníčková.Trump married his third wife Melania Knauss in 2005. When they met seven years earlier, he was 52 and she was 28.His political career started in 2015 when he announced his White House bid during a press conference at Trump Tower surrounded by his family. His motto: “Make America great again”.After a bitter campaign marked by controversy, he beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in 2017.His presidency was an uncertain time for US allies, often clashing openly with foreign leaders. He withdrew from major climate and trade agreements and launched a trade war with China.The final year of his presidency was dominated by criticism over his handling of the Covid pandemic. Trump was forced to take a break during his 2020 election campaign after being diagnosed with the virus.Trump lost the 2020 presidential race to Joe Biden but refused to accept the result, claiming the election had been rigged. He rallied supporters in Washington on 6 January urging them to march to Congress.The rally escalated into a riot and his actions on that day are the focus of two criminal cases.His political career had seemed over, but he announced another run for president and quickly became the Republican Party frontrunner.Trump began the general election campaign facing 91 felony charges.In May 2024 he was found guilty of 34 counts of fraud related to hush money paid to adult-film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.Back on the campaign trail over the summer, a 20-year-old gunman tried to assassinate him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.Days later at the Republican National Convention, he was confirmed as the party’s presidential candidate.After an eventful, at times frenzied, campaign, Trump has won the 2024 US presidential election. His confirmation as president will make him the country's oldest ever leader. He’ll be 82 by the end of his term.Picture selection by Yazmina GarciaAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Donald Trump has offered a sweeping immigration pitch that he has promised to begin on the first day of his presidency, including mass deportations and a major crackdown on illegal border crossings. Arizona could find itself on the frontline of these moves, and the sharply divided state is contending with what they could mean.In the Phoenix home of the Villalobos family, members across three generations discussed Donald Trump's decisive election victory with their friends.Over Latin jazz and a dinner of empanadas, beans and rice, the group - mostly women - were close to tears.“I really had hope for humanity, and I feel like we were let down,” said Monica Villalobos, 45. “It changes the way we think about ourselves in the Latino community.”Her family made America their home after immigrating from Jalisco, Mexico. They worry that friends and relatives' families could be torn apart with deportations.Trump has promised the biggest mass deportations of migrants in US history, and has pledged to seal the border and stop the “migrant invasion". He is also promising to hire 10,000 Border Patrol agents and says he will ask Congress to give all agents a 10 % pay raise.His message is one that resonates with many voters here who consistently rank immigration and border security as top concerns. Many detail seeing the impacts of illegal migration firsthand, but voters are divided on how to handle it.Arizona was, for a time, a Republican stronghold. Trump was the first to lose here in more than 20 years when Joe Biden came out victorious in 2020. The 2024 result is still too close to call - a testament to just how split residents are.Voters on Tuesday, however, overwhelmingly approved a Republican-supported measure that gives sheriffs, police and state law enforcement the authority to enforce federal immigration laws and arrest those who cross the border illegally. It had faced opposition from Democratic and Latino groups, who argue it could result in racial profiling.There are an estimated 12 million undocumented migrants in the US, and many have lived and worked here for decades. When discussing Trump's mass deportation proposals, Ms Villalobos's niece, 19-year-old university student Alexandra de Leon, said they were "terrifying".“It’s your neighbours, it's the people you see in the grocery store, it's your teachers, it's your friend’s parents,” she said. “To know that those people are in danger and their families could be torn apart at any moment… it's heartbreaking.”One of the main storylines of election night was the extent to which Trump racked up huge support from Latino voters nationwide. He saw a mammoth 14 percentage-point bump compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls.One of these supporters is Jorge Gonzalez, Sr, who moved his family to Arizona from Mexico 20 years ago in the hope of building a more prosperous future. Now the proud owner of a body shop in Phoenix, he believes Trump’s policies will help him as a business owner.“As a person I don’t like him, but as a politician, I like how he ran the economy. Many Latinos probably think he managed the country better,” he said.“He allowed a large number of undocumented workers to come here and get work visas. I didn't see any family separations,” he added. “I saw that he integrated and allowed undocumented immigrants to live and work here in a regulated way."Across the yard, Jorge’s son, Jorge Jr, was under a car examining brake pads and checking an engine.As he swapped out wrenches, he said Trump had the right tools to be a successful president.“I don't like his attitude. His mouth gets the better of him a lot of times, but when you are in a position of power or leadership, you need to be able to be a little bit tough,” he said.When asked about the mass, militarised deportations Trump campaigned on in his home state, Jorge Jr just laughed.“That's impossible!” he said, noting the millions of undocumented immigrants in the US. “You will need a lot of resources, planes, food, detention centres, police, more ICE officers, so I don't think it will be feasible.”If the Trump administration were to move forward with mass deportations, they would likely face a host of challenges. Experts are wary that federal immigration authorities do not have proper staffing to track down migrants, or the capacity to hold them until a court date.“You learn to develop a thick skin, especially coming from where we come from,” Jorge Jr said. “We don't pay attention to a lot of the things that people say, because we know those are just words and there's a long gap between the things that we say and the things that we actually do.”Others are excited to see Trump's proposals come to fruition.Mark Lamb, the sheriff in Pinal County - a conservative area just south-east of Phoenix - said Trump winning the White House would deter migrants.“Once you start holding people accountable, securing the border, you're going to start to see a lot of these folks will go back on their own. And then we can start to go after the criminals, people that are causing problems in communities.”But how Trump’s policies will actually work on the ground is still anyone’s guess.“I don't think anybody has the resources right now,” Sheriff Lamb said. “But the people he picks are going to really have to figure out what that looks like.”Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: With just one day to go, the race for the White House is deadlocked - both at the national level and in the all-important battleground states.The polls are so close, within the margin of error, that either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris could actually be two or three points better off - enough to win comfortably.There is a compelling case to make for why each may have the edge when it comes to building a coalition of voters in the right places, and then ensuring they actually turn out.Let’s start with the history-making possibility that a defeated president might be re-elected for the first time in 130 years.The economy is the number one issue for voters, and while unemployment is low and the stock market is booming, most Americans say they are struggling with higher prices every day.Inflation hit levels not seen since the 1970s in the aftermath of the pandemic, giving Trump the chance to ask “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”In 2024, voters around the world have several times thrown out the party in power, partly due to the high, post-Covid, cost of living. US voters also seem hungry for change.Only a quarter of Americans say they are satisfied with the direction the country is going in and two-thirds have a poor economic outlook.Harris has tried to be the so-called change candidate, but as vice-president has struggled to distance herself from an unpopular Joe Biden.Despite the fallout from the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, a string of indictments and an unprecedented criminal conviction, Trump’s support has remained stable all year at 40% or above.While Democrats and “Never-Trump” conservatives say he is unfit for office, most Republicans agree when Trump says he’s the victim of a political witch-hunt.With both sides so dug in, he just needs to win over enough of the small slice of undecided voters without a fixed view of him.Beyond the state of the economy, elections are often decided by an issue with an emotional pull.Democrats will hope it’s abortion, while Trump is betting it’s immigration.After encounters at the border hit record levels under Biden, and the influx impacted states far from the border, polls suggest voters trust Trump more on the immigration - and that he’s doing much better with Latinos than in previous elections.Trump’s appeal to voters who feel forgotten and left behind has transformed US politics by turning traditional Democratic constituencies like union workers into Republicans and making the protection of American industry by tariffs almost the norm.If he drives up turnout in rural and suburban parts of swing states this can offset the loss of moderate, college-educated Republicans.Trump’s detractors say he undermines America’s alliances by cosying up to authoritarian leaders.The former president sees his unpredictability as a strength, however, and points out that no major wars started when he was in the White House.Many Americans are angry, for different reasons, with the US sending billions to Ukraine and Israel - and think America is weaker under Biden.A majority of voters, especially men who Trump has courted through podcasts like Joe Rogan's, see Trump as a stronger leader than Harris.Despite Trump’s advantages, he remains a deeply polarising figure.In 2020, he won a record number of votes for a Republican candidate, but was defeated because seven million more Americans turned out to support Biden.This time, Harris is playing up the fear factor about a Trump return. She’s called him a “fascist” and a threat to democracy, while vowing to move on from “drama and conflict”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll in July indicated that four in five Americans felt the country was spiralling out of control. Harris will be hoping voters - especially moderate Republicans and independents - see her as a candidate of stability.Democrats were facing near-certain defeat at the point Biden dropped out of the race. United in their desire to beat Trump, the party quickly rallied around Harris. With impressive speed from a standing start, she delivered a more forward-looking message that excited the base.While Republicans have tied her to Biden’s more unpopular policies, Harris has rendered some of their Biden-specific attack lines redundant.The clearest of these is age - polls consistently suggested voters had real concerns about Biden’s fitness for office. Now the race has flipped, and it is Trump who’s vying to become the oldest person to ever win the White House.This is the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.Voters concerned about protecting abortion rights overwhelmingly back Harris, and we’ve seen in past elections - notably the 2022 midterms - that the issue can drive turnout and have a real impact on the result.This time around, 10 states, including the swing state Arizona, will have ballot initiatives asking voters how abortion should be regulated. This could boost turnout in Harris’s favour.The historic nature of her bid to become the first female president may also strengthen her significant lead among women voters.The groups Harris is polling more strongly with, such as the college-educated and older people, are more likely to vote.Democrats ultimately perform better with high-turnout groups, while Trump has made gains with relatively low-turnout groups such as young men and those without college degrees.Trump, for example, holds a huge lead among those who were registered but didn’t vote in 2020, according to a New York Times/Siena poll.A key question, then, is whether they will show up this time.It’s no secret that American elections are expensive, and 2024 is on track to be the most expensive ever.But when it comes to spending power - Harris is on top. She’s raised more since becoming the candidate in July than Trump has in the entire period since January 2023, according to a recent Financial Times analysis, which also noted that her campaign has spent almost twice as much on advertising.This could play a role in a razor-tight race that will ultimately be decided by voters in swing states currently being bombarded by political ads.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an “unprecedented and powerful” mandate to govern.He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.Trump’s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history.But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting.His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a "landslide" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues."It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide," said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House.That is thanks to America’s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.Here are three ways to look at his win.With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC’s US partner, CBS News.That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.In 2024, Trump’s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate "may be overwrought", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to "justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government".On a different metric, Trump’s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris’s 226.And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.Trump’s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.And it is important to remember that the “winner takes all” mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.There is another measure with which to consider Trump’s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved.Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket.Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to "2019 prices" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze."The real story is Harris’s inability to mobilise people who voted for Biden in 2020," he said.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the presidential election in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: When Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020, it seemed to be the death knell of his political career.His first term in office ended in chaos and condemnation - even from members of his own party.If he wins the election on Tuesday, it will be only the second time anyone has ever returned to the White House after previously losing a presidential re-election bid.“He gets knocked down and gets up twice as focused,” said Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser for the former president since Trump launched his 2016 campaign. “I don't think anybody should be surprised about this comeback.”Such an extraordinary reversal of fortune for the 78-year-old former president would also vault him back into the White House as a man who seems politically bulletproof, with a detailed plan of action and ranks of loyalists behind him.Four years ago, Trump appeared a beaten man. His Democratic opponent, Biden, had defeated him by a comfortable electoral margin in the 2020 presidential contest.Courts had batted away his attempts to contest those results. His last-ditch rally in which he urged his supporters to march on the US Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the results culminated in the crowd launching a violent attack that sent those inside scrambling for safety. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were injured.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao were among a spate of Trump administration officials who quit in protest. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” DeVos wrote in her letter of resignation to the president.Even South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies, broke with the president.“All I can say is count me out,” he said on the floor of the Senate. “Enough is enough.”The movement away from Trump extended into the corporate world, as dozens of large companies – including American Express, Microsoft, Nike and Walgreens – announced they were suspending support for Republicans who had challenged the results of the 2020 election.On the day of Biden’s inauguration, Trump broke with 152 years of tradition by declining to attend the ceremony, instead flying back to his private club in Mar-a-Lago earlier that morning, accompanied by a handful of his closest aides and family.His mood was sullen, according to Meridith McGraw, author of Trump in Exile, an account of the former president’s time after leaving the White House.“He was angry, frustrated, unsure of how to spend his days and without a plan for his political future,” she said.The media coverage and political chatter that month reflected this uncertainty over his future. After a clear electoral defeat followed by the chaotic scenes at the Capitol, some were even more definitive, suggesting there was no way back for Trump.“And just like that, the bold, combustible and sometimes brilliant political career of Donald J. Trump comes to an end,” one opinion piece in The Hill read.The subheading of a January 2021 opinion piece in The New York Times declared: “The terrible experiment is over.” The headline was even more direct: “President Donald J. Trump: The End.”But before Trump left for Florida on inauguration day, he hinted at what was to come.“We love you,” he said in remarks to supporters on a Maryland Air Force base tarmac. “We will be back in some form.”A week later, it became clear that Trump wouldn’t have to wait long to assert his continued political influence. The party came back to him.California Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, paid the former president a visit at Mar-a-Lago, posing for a photo next to a beaming Trump.In the immediate aftermath of the 6 January attack, McCarthy had said that Trump “bears responsibility” for the mob violence and recommended that Congress formally censure him for his conduct. Now he was pledging to work with the former president to win a congressional majority in the next year’s mid-term elections.Even as the Democrat-controlled US Senate was preparing to hold Trump’s impeachment trial, McCarthy’s Palm Beach pilgrimage illustrated that one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress still viewed the former president as a king-maker.“McCarthy’s visit really opened the door for Trump,” said McGraw.“It was a permission slip to Republicans who had criticised Trump to forgive him and move on.”Trump’s Senate trial would end in acquittal, as most Republicans – including some outspoken critics like minority leader Mitch McConnell – voted against a conviction that could have led to the former president being banned from future elective office.McConnell had said that Trump’s conduct on 6 January was “a disgraceful dereliction of duty”, but he chose not to take the one step that could have conclusively ended the former president’s political career – perhaps out of fear of effectively ending his own.Republicans also worried that the former president might start a third party that would siphon off support from Republicans – concerns that Trump’s closest aides did little to dispel.“It’s clearly up to Republicans if this is something that becomes more serious,” Jason Miller, a long-time Trump communications aide, said in an interview with Fox News.The former president spent the next month mostly within the comfortable confines of his Mar-a-Lago club, venturing out only for a round of golf or a private dinner.By the end of February, as the furore around 6 January ebbed, he was ready to hold his first public event.At the Conservative Political Action Conference – the right-wing confab typically held near Washington, DC but relocated to Orlando, Florida, due to Covid restrictions – the former president demonstrated that he still commanded the loyalty of the Republican base.Addressing thousands of cheering supporters in a sprawling hotel conference centre, Trump basked in the glow of their adoration.“I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together,” he said, “is far from over.”He also hinted, coyly, that he might beat the Democrats “for a third time” in 2024.An official straw poll of conference attendees only underlined what by then was obvious. Sixty-eight percent of respondents said Trump should run again. Fifty-five percent said they would vote for him in a contested primary – more then double the second-place candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis."Trump and his team were pretty nervous about that speech,” McGraw said. “Psychologically it was a really important moment for Trump and his allies when he got such a positive reception.”After a brief hiatus, Trump reactivated his steady stream of fundraising emails to supporters and resumed holding his carnival-like outdoor rallies.“Do you miss me?” Trump asked at a June gathering in Ohio. The crowd responded with cheers.“They miss me,” he concluded.If 2021 hinted at Trump’s continuing influence within the Republican Party, the 2022 midterm elections confirmed it.By then, American military forces had haphazardly withdrawn from Afghanistan, leading to the fall of that nation’s US-backed government. Gas prices and inflation were approaching highs not seen in decades. US economic growth, which had been bouncing back from pandemic disruptions, sputtered.Biden’s approval ratings tumbled into negative territory. The political environment that had seemed so hostile to Trump at the beginning of 2021 was starting to shift.“Joe Biden failed to address the primary concerns of the voters,” said Lanza. “That gave Donald Trump an opening.”Mar-a-Lago became an obligatory stopping point for any conservative candidate seeking to become their party’s nominee. The former president’s endorsement was the most coveted prize – a key to unlocking fundraising dollars and grassroots conservative support.Four of the six Republican House members who voted for Trump’s second impeachment and were running for re-election were defeated by Trump-backed candidates in party primaries. Meanwhile, Senate candidates like JD Vance in Ohio and Herschel Walker in Georgia pulled ahead in crowded primary fields with the help of Trump’s support.”His endorsement all but guarantees you a primary win,” said Brian Seitchik, who worked as Arizona state director for Trump’s campaign in 2016 and as the western regional director in 2020.But if the first half of 2022 was unambiguous good news for the former president, November’s elections painted a much different picture.Of four prominent Trump-endorsed Senate candidates, only one – author turned politician Vance – defeated his Democratic opponent. While Republicans narrowly regained control of the House of Representatives, elevating Kevin McCarthy to the speakership, the party largely underperformed and Democrats retained control of the Senate.In Florida, Governor DeSantis, the distant second-place finisher in that 2021 presidential straw poll, won a surprising double-digit re-election victory, fuelling speculation that he might be the real frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.Meanwhile, Trump fumed – blaming the Republican shortcomings on the party’s support of unpopular abortion restrictions and insufficient fealty to his own brand of conservative populism. Only a few weeks after the midterms, when pundits were still wondering if the former president’s political moment had passed, Trump formally launched his 2024 presidential campaign.The start of his presidential bid seemed shockingly ill-timed. Just a few weeks after the Republican midterm misfire, it put the former president in the headlines when many were still wondering if he had lost his political instincts.His formal announcement, held within the cozy confines of Mar-a-Lago, made his campaign feel insular and ill-suited to the current political realities.He would subsequently make news for all the wrong reasons - dining at Mar-a-Lago with Nick Fuentes, a prominent white nationalist, and posting on social media that rules in the US Constitution should be “terminated”, allowing him to be re-instated as president.“Thanksgiving through New Year’s was a pretty dark time on the Trump campaign,” McGraw said. Republicans were having their doubts.“He's announced that he's running for president, but are we sure that he's going to be able to pull this off?” she said, describing the mood at the time. “Does he have the discipline to actually do this?”Behind the scenes, however, Trump was assembling a campaign staff that – unlike 2016 and even 2020 – was headed by seasoned political operatives. Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles may not be household names, but the former was a bare-knuckled veteran of Republican politics with decades of experience and the latter had helped turn Florida into a conservative stronghold.The two worked with Trump to formulate a presidential primary strategy.While DeSantis was bogged down with official duties in Florida, Trump moved early to define the contours of the campaign, Lanza said. And while others deferred to the Florida governor, Trump hit him head-on, demeaning and diminishing him.“Everybody thought Ron DeSantis was at this powerful apex of politics that could not be torn down,” Lanza said. “Donald Trump tore the guy down.”The Trump side also received a boost from the unlikeliest of sources – prosecutors in New York, Georgia and the Justice Department in Washington, DC.Starting with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for sensitive national security documents in August 2022 and culminating in a series of indictments in 2023, the former president’s criminal jeopardy became a central issue in the rapidly unfolding Republican presidential nomination fight. Trump’s mugshot, glaring in a photograph taken at an Atlanta jail in August, was soon plastered on campaign t-shirts and yard signs.For many on the left, justice was finally being served. But among the kind of conservative voters who choose their party’s nominee in early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, it became a moment to rally around their party’s embattled leader.Conservative pollster Sarah Longwell interviewed a panel of Iowa Republicans for PBS in June 2023, a week after the Justice Department indicted Trump on charges related to mishandling sensitive government documents.“I think he’s being set up,” said one."This is election interference like we have never seen before,” said another.The indictments, according to Lanza, created a divide within the Republican Party between those who saw the indictment as an abuse of power and those who didn’t.“Initially, Ron DeSantis took the ‘didn't’ approach,” he said. “And he became roadkill.”DeSantis had at first called the March 2023 New York indictment, which he noted was about Trump’s hush-money payments to an adult film star, a “manufactured circus” that wasn’t a “real issue”.By autumn 2023, Trump had opened a massive lead in most Republican primary polls – a margin he would never relinquish. He skipped the Republican primary debates, depriving them of political oxygen. He focused instead on cementing support among rank-and-file voters through his trademark rallies and grass-roots organising.Despite raising nearly $200 million in campaign funds, DeSantis was out of the race within days of finishing a distant second in the January 2024 Iowa Caucuses. After Trump easily beat former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, the Republican primary fight was effectively over. For the third straight presidential election, the party’s nomination was his.The former president’s courtroom drama may have been a boon to his political fortunes, but it also came with very real legal jeopardy. In May 2024, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump on 34 felony counts involving hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.Every judicial setback, however, seemed to be followed by a bigger victory. His sentencing was delayed until after the election, the document indictments in Florida were discarded, and the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have sweeping immunity for official acts.Outside of court chambers, Trump’s campaign was rolling from his primary victory into the general election faceoff. A halting, confused performance by Biden in his late June debate with the former president left Democrats in a full-blown panic.Trump’s approval ratings and head-to-head polling numbers were ticking ever higher. And after his brush with an assassin’s bullet in Pennsylvania in mid-July, he arrived at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee a day later as a conquering hero to his supporters.“What we saw at the convention was how unified the Republican Party appeared, really for the first time in a long time,” said McGraw. “They were feeling incredibly confident.”Tesla chief Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, publicly endorsed the former president and began funding a massive organising operation in key battleground states. Republican pride – pride in Trump – was running high.At that moment, it seemed like Trump’s return to the pinnacles of American power from the depths of 6 January 2021 was all but complete. A campaign that had first vanquished DeSantis and his other Republican rivals was now set to deliver a knock-out punch to Biden and the Democrats.But three days after Trump formally accepted the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, Biden abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris.In a matter of a few weeks, Harris consolidated her party’s support, injected new enthusiasm into Democrats and even pulled ahead of the former president in some head-to head polls.Trump’s efforts were not helped by a scattershot debate performance against Harris in September and an apparent difficulty reorienting his campaign to take on his new opponent, whose strengths – and weaknesses – are decidedly different from Biden’s.“Trump really wasn't tested until Harris got into the race,” said Seitchik. “Everything up to that point almost felt like an extended preseason for the campaign.”With election day looming, the season is almost over and the champion is still in doubt.The race is where it seemed to be headed at the beginning of the year – a photo finish where either candidate could end up on top. And for a campaign that had focused on Biden’s age and frailty, it is now Trump whose stamina and coherence are under the microscope.“Trump can have an incredibly professional, streamlined operation around him, but at the end of the day, he's still going to do what he wants and do things the way he wants,” said McGraw.That includes a continued public insistence that he did not lose the 2020 election, extended rhetorical diversions during rally speeches and last-minute cancellations of media appearances that some have attributed to “exhaustion”.Trump has been in the whirlwind of presidential politics for nine years now – and in the public spotlight for more than four decades. He has seemed indefatigable. But with another four years in the White House looming on the horizon, are the cracks beginning to show?While Trump’s victory is far from guaranteed, simply being this close to the prize once again is itself a remarkable achievement. And if his political comeback culminates in another presidential term, he will return to the White House having overcome obstacles – legal, political, many of his own creation – that few presidents have confronted.With control of the reins of power, and without the burden of having to face the judgement of voters again, Trump will be able to make those legal dangers disappear. And unlike his first term, he will be entering the White House with a team of advisers and potential administration staff who are fully loyal to him.His intent to dramatically reorganise the federal bureaucracy could replace career civil service employees with political acolytes. And even if he doesn’t win full control of Congress, he could use existing presidential powers to impose new restrictions on immigration, enact his plans for mass deportation of undocumented residents and impose tariffs that are designed to protect US jobs but could significantly increase the cost of imported goods.Democrats warn that this would be a presidency without “guardrails” to limit what they say are Trump’s more dangerous proposals. Republicans, in a party that has been remade in Trump’s image, hope that he will be able to more effectively enact his agenda without the internal resistance he faced in his first term.“Donald Trump has converted the party from fiscal issues and social issues being the dominant force to a Trump populism,” Seitchik said. “This is all a fundamental reorientation of the Republican Party.”And if he wins next week, Trump could fundamentally reshape American government for generations to come.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Rumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election.Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats.The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process.The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.Many posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign’s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November.When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a "fair and legal and good election".A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday.Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state.“Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network. “REPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!”The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud.While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of "half-truths" and disinformation circulating on social media.“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” he said.The BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each.The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process.One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia.The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by "Russian influence actors".Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: “Figured I would drive across the border and vote."It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border.Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.Experts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond.It's happened before.In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. "Stop the steal" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results.On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats.While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day.Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists “are preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren’t in 2020”.“We cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,” she said.These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning.“I feel very confident about Trump, as long as there’s no cheating,” said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he’d already heard rumours about fraud. “Our only hope is that it’s not big enough to change the result.”After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.Experts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters.But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating.In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud.“They WILL cheat,” says one of the thousands of comments posted.As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards.But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to “rig” the election.“Look at this new cheat voter fraud,” read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. “Dems already doing their best to steal another election.”The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say.“These incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,” said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations.Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security.On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities.They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure.“Our hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,” said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters.But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale.“If they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they’re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,” she added.The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment.A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities.Elon Musk’s America political action committee has started a community – akin to a message board – on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock.Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers – partisan observers who attend polling places.The volume of messages on these platforms – along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources – makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation.The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.The effect of this is unpredictable.The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC’s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists.And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner.Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an “ecosystem of distrust”.But despite the doubts being sown, he says, “accurate information is getting out there".“Election officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,” Mr Lozada said. “That’s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.”With reporting by BBC VerifyAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: By Obed Manuel, Destinee AdamsBraddock, Pa., on Oct. 16, 2024.With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the largest battleground prize — meaning the road to victory most likely runs through here.Just days before the election, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are barnstorming the state to rally support. The state was decided by about a percentage point in 2020, and the vote expected to be close again.To see how the candidates' messages are resonating, Morning Edition hosts Michel Martin and Steve Inskeep each led teams across Pennsylvania, stopping in Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, Allentown, Philadelphia and other towns to talk with voters.The Pennsylvanians we met reflect a divided electorate. Some are voting for Harris, inspired by her vision that they say represents stability for them and because they want to see a woman as president. Others are voting for Trump because they believe in his economic policies and promises. And a few weren’t so sure about either candidate.These are some of the people we met along the way.We met Wallace at a site in New Kensington owned by Penneco Environmental Solutions, where he serves as its chief operating officer. Large tanker trucks full of recovered water used during fracking drove onto the site as we spoke. The water is treated and injected deep under the earth’s surface — a controversial practice due to concerns about water contamination.Ben Wallace, chief operating officer at Penneco Affiliated Companies, poses for a portrait an injection well in Plum, Pa., on Oct. 15, 2024.Wallace denies that the practice is unsafe and doesn’t believe in human-caused climate change. He argues that industry regulations added over decades have led to hundreds of thousands in additional costs to his business and he believes Trump would be friendlier to the industry.“This is kind of an argument I give to environmental activists all the time. Show me the industry. You know, you are in the Saudi Arabia of natural gas right now,” Wallace said. “You are standing here and you don't see the industry anywhere.”Wallace helps lead a political action committee that runs billboard ads supporting Trump and said his support of the former president goes beyond his work.He backs Trump because of what he believes are American values, which he explained as “The right of self-determination, the right to be a Christian nation, the right to determine your own outcome, the right to be free of government interference.”Faust said she’s tired of seeing so much division in the country, and she feels that the country electing a woman of color is the kind of change the U.S. needs.She began working in manufacturing to support her three daughters after a divorce. She worked the job until her body couldn’t handle it. She eventually needed surgery on both elbows. Though insurance has gotten more expensive, she still credits the union’s strong bargaining for previous health benefits. Her three daughters are all college graduates now.Rose Faust poses for a portrait in Oakmont, Pa., on Oct. 15, 2024.Ahead of the election, Faust is knocking on doors of union members, both active and retired, to encourage them to vote. She said many of the older, retired members acknowledge that the union helped obtain many benefits they enjoyed during their working days.Faust said she reminds them that President Biden signed into law the Butch Lewis Act, designed to protect their pensions, and that it only passed the U.S. Senate when Vice President Harris cast a tie-breaking vote.“They take their union and their retirement seriously,” Faust said. ‘They’ll say ‘Hey, we’re Democrat no matter what. We know how we got our jobs. We know who took care of us all these years.’”But others dismiss her sales pitch. Some members support Trump, voicing their concerns about immigrants and asylum seekers.Faust is baffled by the lack of empathy for those fleeing violence and seeking better lives. Their struggles resonate deeply with her; she was born into a troubled family and grew up in foster care.“I would open my home to anybody. Somebody opened their home to me years and years ago. Had that not happened, where would I have been? I could have been on the streets too, you know,” Faust said.He has worked for U.S. Steel for nearly three decades and is active in the local union. For him, this work represents the American dream, which is why he supports the U.S. Steel’s sale to Nippon Steel of Japan. He, like others we spoke to in this economically depressed area, believes the sale could save jobs.But neither candidate is winning him over on this issue that directly affects him because they both oppose the sale. He was truly an undecided voter, but that didn’t mean he was without his views on the election or planned to sit out like he did in 2020.William Timbers, a U.S. Steel worker and steelworkers union member, poses for a portrait in Rankin, Pa. on Oct. 16, 2024.“One candidate ain’t always going to line up with everything you believe in, so I got to go with the pros and cons,” Timbers said. “As of right now, I haven't made a choice. And everybody saying, ‘you haven't made a choice? You’re the last person in Pennsylvania’”Timbers is concerned about Trump saying the country needs to have “one really violent day,” as a way to deter theft and property crime. “Violence begets violence,” Timbers said.He added that, as a Christian man, what he loves about Trump is his pro-life stance — which was part of why he voted for him in 2016.As for Harris, Timbers described her as “independent and strong on her views and her values and. I believe she may be a good candidate.”Could he vote for a pro-choice candidate, we asked?He stopped, smiled, chuckled and took a deep breath.“That's a hard question,” Timbers said. “Yes, I could. If when you go through the checklist, if the checks is more pros than cons, I could.”Powell, who has lived here for 42 years, describes himself as a "firm believer in America" and is backing Trump.“We’re going backwards. I mean, 15 million immigrants coming in here,” Powell said. “God knows where they're at. New York City's got one square block right now where you don't dare go because they're fighting each other.”Jack Powell, a Korea War veteran, poses for a portrait at his in-home woodshop in Gettysburg, Pa., on Oct. 17, 2024.Estimates show that closer to 6 million migrants have entered the country under Biden without authorization or have been paroled into the U.S. under various programs.Powell, who gets most of his news from the local Gettysburg Times — and YouTube — has just one big concern about his candidate:“I wish he’d keep [his] mouth shut sometime, but then again, we all get our mouths in trouble.”Matthew Nell, 22, poses for a portrait outside his family home in Gettysburg, Pa., on Oct. 17, 2024.Nell, a local college student who has done voter outreach for Harris and other Democrats, lives with his parents and grandparents. His minivan displays a bumper sticker in support of Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. John Fetterman.The 22-year-old said he’s concerned about the effect of misinformation and disinformation on democracy. He worries about how false stories and conspiracy theories spread easily online and make their way around the country and the world.“We are more connected than ever and it's leading us to more division than ever,” Nell said. “There has to be a way we can change education in a way that will allow for people to have more individuality within this sea of information [and] to have informed opinions that are closer to reality.”Rivaling Trump and Harris lawn signs sit on the side of a road in Gettysburg, Pa. on Oct. 17, 2024.Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Dominguez moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, becoming a leader in Allentown’s emerging Latino community, which now makes up more than half the city’s population. He founded HALA, the Hispanic American League of Artists, to support Latino artists and preserve Latin culture.“In speaking with folks, you see this wave of change within communities of color, and the conversations have been really fascinating at the barbershops in the different places that I visit and talk to people,” Dominguez said. We met Dominguez at a roundtable discussion NPR organized with local voters.He’s fascinated by the way his community is engaging in politics at this moment.“They are listening to everything, but they're also paying attention to what they're seeing from a body language perspective and then what they can repeat and translate from Spanish to English,” Dominguez said.He said the language Trump uses is “embarrassing” and that he couldn’t repeat, or even translate, some words and ideas at the dinner table with his family.“Some Latinos that were kind of leaning towards Trump, are kind of backing away because they can't say what he's saying at the kitchen table,” Dominguez shared. “There's this embarrassing factor that's affecting our community. And so it's hard to defend him when he's offending us at the same time.”For this reason, Dominguez said Harris will win the election.After listening to others express support for Harris, Opp took a sip of water, sat up straight and said, “I'm a Republican. Yes, I'm voting for Trump.”Jeffrey Opp, a voter from the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, stands for a portrait on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024.A few ‘humphs’ and slight grunts were audible at the table, but Opp sat patiently as everyone spoke. He responded to any questions directed at him, including why he’s voting for Trump.“Track record,” he said, “We had four years of Donald Trump, you look at the economics, we were stronger in the world. Then you look at four years of Biden-Harris — high inflation, no job creation, the economy isn't as good as it was. And we're weaker in the world.”Some participants chimed in when Opp spoke, and there was a brief argument. But when the conversation ended, he shook everyone’s hands, hugged a few, and stood smiling for a picture with the whole group.We met Rivera at La Cocina Del Abuelo, a Latino-owned restaurant on a busy street where cars strolled by blasting bachata.Rivera was born in New York City, where he was involved in gang activity at a young age. In an attempt to get him away from that lifestyle, his mother moved him to Allentown. But she couldn’t keep him from it, and he got involved in gang activity in the new city and was incarcerated several times. Years later, at age 52, he’s a leader in his community.A “2024 Take America Back” flag sits on a home in Lancaster, Pa., on Oct. 18, 2024.Slim, tall and with slick-back hair, he sat and ate among several vocal Harris supporters, but didn’t hesitate to criticize her campaign.“I can say the messaging on both sides has been horrible,” Rivera said. “When someone [campaigning for Harris] calls the house and says — vote for us because you don’t want a convicted felon in the White House. [I say] hold up, I'm a convicted felon.”He said he doesn’t feel completely welcomed by either campaign.“I might not like him [Trump], but now you’re pushing me towards him,” Rivera said. “Because if he can win the White House, I can go for City Council, I can go for mayor, it opens up doors.”Although he said he has something in common with Trump, he did not say who he would vote for come November.Lopez, a local Latino radio personality, sat at the table across from Rivera. Though she nodded when others’ spoke positively about Harris, she expressed the need to make an informed decision.“I don’t want to make a mistake — or just be like, ‘Oh, she’s a female, she’s Black.’ You have to study her and you have to study every candidate.”Like Rivera, Alfa didn’t say who she would vote for, or give any indication of which candidate she’s leaning toward. But she’s confident about one thing:“My honest opinion, I don’t think the United States in general is ready to have a female. And that being said, I think Donald Trump is gonna win.”We met Hamou, 27, at Rittenhouse Square, where police sirens and car horns echoed. Streets were closed because Harris was in town.“She’s right over there,” Hamou said, smiling and looking in the direction of where the sound was loudest.Yasmine Hamou poses for a portrait at Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2024.Hamou recalled knocking on doors with her mother for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 around Gettysburg and nearby Hanover and staying up way past her bedtime to watch him declare victory.“I just remember the excitement and the energy, even in such a conservative place, [about] this historic moment,” Hamou said. “It was one of the most powerful things I’ve ever done…I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.”Now working on voter outreach for Philadelphia’s Working Families Party. Hamou is focused on engaging with Democrats and independents.As the daughter of a Black mother from the south and an Egyptian immigrant father, she’s inspired by Harris’ accomplishments as a woman of color.“I know how difficult it is when you speak up in the workplace. You have to work 10 times as hard to get half the result as your white peers,” Hamou said. “When I was voting for her, I got a little emotional because I couldn’t believe I was seeing her name.”But she’s not without reservations about the vice president. Hamou would’ve liked to hear Harris take a firmer stance against Israel’s actions in Gaza, including an arms embargo. She believes, however, that a vote for Harris is still progress and could yet lead to a more peaceful resolution than under Trump.A small band of Vice President Harris supporters march on South Broad Street in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2024.“The number one thing we need to do is block white supremacy and the far right,” Hamou said. “Anchoring myself in that, and being grounded in knowing that, is how we get progressive wins and we can build a future that we want to see.”Obed Manuel and Steve Inskeep reported from Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, and Philadelphia. Destinee Adams and Michel Martin reported from Allentown and Bethlehem.Majd Al-Waheidi edited.

CONTENT: By Kathryn Fink, Ashley Brown, Scott Detrow, Tyler BartlamAndrea Farmer (left) and Alex Cook mark off homes they have visited on their app while canvassing in a neighborhood in Nashville, North Carolina in October.Jakai Britton was not planning on casting a ballot this election season. When a group of door knockers came to his neighborhood, he wasn’t planning on having a conversation, either. But in the span of a couple minutes, he’d agreed to both.Britton, a 28-year-old non-affiliated voter in Nash County, North Carolina, was pulling out of his driveway in a black SUV, airport bound, when a canvasser from the organization Down Home North Carolina approached his car.“Can we get five minutes of your time?” door knocker Alex Cook asked. Her plea for five minutes turned into a plea for two minutes, and Britton said yes. From the passenger side window, while Britton’s car was still running, Cook made her case for why he should vote for the Democratic down-ballot candidates the organization had endorsed. She focused on the way the local races would impact health care, an issue that resonated with Britton.“So, do we have a vote from you?” Cook asked.“Yeah, you’ve got a vote from me,” Britton said.To Down Home North Carolina, the stakes of the 2024 election are too high to let a potential voter like Britton go. Nash County is near-evenly divided between white and Black residents, and in recent presidential elections, it was near-evenly divided by its results. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the rural county by two-tenths of a point. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won it by the exact razor-thin margin.Alex Cook makes her case to Jakai BrittonDown Home North Carolina is trying to reach as many potential voters as possible.In the small town of Nashville, where the group canvassed that day, it did not feel evenly divided. There were Trump signs everywhere, and plenty of MAGA flags. Still, Down Home found plenty of Democratic and non-affiliated doors to knock on.“What I noticed is that there's a lot of people who want to stay out the way,” said Adon Bermudez-Bey, Down Home’s regional field director. “They see the Trump signs, they see what's going on in the school boards, city council. They're just like, ‘I'm going to stay out of it.’ We're trying to tell them there's an organization that specifically focuses on rural areas to pull those folks out.”Bermudez-Bey said Down Home’s platform was “survival,” helping poor and working class people get basic needs met like housing and education. In an election season like this one, the organization is mostly focused on local races, but they endorse candidates up and down the ticket, usually Democrats. Most of their time is spent urging residents — especially residents of color — to get out and vote.“They don’t open the door all the time,” Cook said. “So one out of 10 doors, you might get someone.”North Carolina's state Democratic chair, Anderson Clayton, is also focused on turnout this election. The 26-year-old from rural Person County is the youngest state party chair in the country.“Joe Biden lost the state by 74,000 votes in 2020, which we know is a field margin, and that can come from all of our counties across the state,” Clayton told NPR in October.Hundreds of campaign signs line the streets of the Nash County Agricultural Center.There are potential barriers to getting those votes. North Carolina has some of the most extreme partisan-drawn maps in the nation. The state’s governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat, but Republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse.Still, Clayton has made reaching out to rural Democrats a key part of her strategy. The stakes are clear: The Tarheel State has more rural voters than any other 2024 presidential swing state.“I'm not going to win rural North Carolina this year. I'm trying to bring back margins in it,” Clayton said. “There's a difference in trying to talk to rural voters and talking to rural Democrats. I'm trying to talk to rural Democrats this year. People that showed up in 2008 that ain't showed up since because they haven't had somebody to vote for and they didn't feel like their vote actually mattered.”Back in Nashville, Down Home door knockers make their pitch to another resident. Sean Jones says he plans on voting, though in the presidential race, he hasn’t made up his mind. He said he’s leaning toward Vice President Kamala Harris.“I just recently went to go see my brother in prison this weekend, and he was kind of on my head about voting,” Jones said. “He wanted me to vote for Trump, but I still wanted to vote for Kamala. So I'm still trying to, like, look into the politics as far as what’s what and who’s who.”Down Home North Carolina canvassers pass out cards with voting information.(From left) canvassers Arquette Turnage, Andrea Farmer and Tynia Anstead check their list of potential voters.So soon before Election Day, finding a true undecided voter can feel like a rarity. But Down Home encounters them all the time, even within their own ranks. Adon Bermudez-Bey, speaking only for himself and not for the organization, told NPR he’s also undecided on the presidential race — even as he led a group of canvassers for an organization that has endorsed Harris.“I don't know if I'm voting for Kamala yet, just full transparency,” Bermudez-Bey said. “But I know that I'm definitely not voting for Trump.”Bermudez-Bey cited his concerns about Harris’ time as a prosecutor in California, and her support for Israel during the ongoing war in the Middle East. He set a deadline for himself: By the last day of early voting in North Carolina, he’ll decide between Harris or a third-party candidate.In the meantime, though, Bermudez-Bey said he still sees the merits of a Harris presidency — at least for Down Home’s goals.“No, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a lot easier for us to organize under her presidency than Trump's,” he said.The motivation of voting against Trump, rather than for Harris, was in the air a dozen miles away at an early voting site in Rocky Mount, Nash County.“I just feel like Donald Trump is for billionaires and not for working class people,” said voter Lynn Jones, who spoke to NPR after casting her ballot for Harris.Her neighbor Donnell Jones, no relation, was by her side. He had just voted for the first time in his life. Lynn said the two of them had had a series of conversations in recent weeks about going to the polls together.Early voting in North Carolina ends on November 2.“I just thought, you know, he was at an age where this just should have happened a lot sooner,” Lynn said. “But I know sometimes people are stuck in their ways, so I didn't pressure him. Just, ‘Hey, let's go vote together then.’”That resulted in one more vote for Harris.“I voted for the lady,” Donnell said.If Democrats win Nash County, and win North Carolina, it will be through thousands of interactions like what Down Home is doing — and on a more casual level, what Lynn Jones did with her neighbor Donnell. The key will be nudging others to show up and vote, regardless of how disengaged or skeptical they were at the beginning of those conversations.Early voting in North Carolina ends on November 2. So far, more than 3.6 million voters have cast their ballots.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has claimed that if he was prime minister he would be able to end small boat crossings “in weeks".Speaking ahead of Saturday’s result, which will see either Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch replace Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party, the MP for Newark told BBC Radio Kent he had resigned from government "because I didn’t want to be another minister who made promises about stopping the boats that I couldn’t keep".So far in 2024, 561 small boats are known to have made the journey across the Channel carrying at least 29,867 migrants.The Home Office said it would "stop at nothing" to dismantle people-smuggling gangs and bring them to justice.When questioned about how quickly he could stop the boats, Jenrick said: “If my approach from earlier this year was put into place I am confident we could stop the boats in weeks, and stop harm to people in Dover for example.”Jenrick said while he was immigration minister he spoke to people in Dover who wanted more done to tackle small boat crossings, adding: “These people were terrified and that’s why we need to leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.“We can’t have sites like Manston overflowing, we can’t have children’s services in the county struggling to help British children because of unaccompanied asylum seeker children arriving, and I want us to sort this now," he said.When asked how he would stop the boats, Jenrick said: “Anyone who arrived here would be deported either to their home country or a safe third country like Rwanda immediately.”The Rwanda scheme, which originated under the Conservatives, aimed to deter small boats crossings in the Channel by sending some people who arrived in the UK illegally to the east African country.However, the plan was stalled by legal challenges and no migrants were sent there before the general election. The scheme was then scrapped by the Labour government.However the former Conservative MP and Attorney General, Dominic Grieve told the BBC: "Only 41% of persons failing to get asylum status after coming to the UK have been removed since 2010."In the case of the vast majority this has nothing to do with the ECHR but with the inability to get their likely country of origin to take them. Claiming that leaving the ECHR will solve this is false."A Home Office spokesperson said: "We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.“The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice.”The spokesperson added that "our new Border Security Command will strengthen our global partnerships and enhance our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute" the gangs.Kemi Badenoch was approached by the BBC for an interview.Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

CONTENT: The president of COP29’s host country has told the UN climate conference that oil and gas are a "gift of God".Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev criticised "Western fake news" about the country's emissions and said nations "should not be blamed" for having fossil fuel reserves.The country plans to expand gas production by up to a third over the next decade.Shortly afterwards, UN chief António Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was "absurd".He said the "clean energy revolution" had arrived and that no government could stop it.Separately, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged further reductions on emissions, saying the UK will now aim for an 81% decrease by 2035. The UK called for other countries to match the new target."Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game," Sir Keir told the conference.Some observers had expressed concerns about the world’s largest climate conference taking place in Azerbaijan.Its minister for ecology and natural resources - a former oil executive that spent 26 years at Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar – is the conference's chairman.There are also concerns that Azerbaijani officials are using COP29 to boost investment in the country’s national oil and gas company.But addressing the conference on its second day, President Aliyev said Azerbaijan had been subject to "slander and blackmail" ahead of COP29.He said it had been as if "Western fake news media", charities and politicians were "competing in spreading disinformation... about our country".Aliyev said the country’s share in global gas emissions was "only 0.1%"."Oil, gas, wind, sun, gold, silver, copper, all... are natural resources and countries should not be blamed for having them, and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them."Oil and gas are a major cause of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.The US is also under the spotlight at the conference, following the election victory of Donald Trump - a known climate sceptic.On Monday, US President Joe Biden's envoy John Podesta called out president-elect Trump's view that climate change was a hoax and said the US team would continue to work on the deal passed at COP28 in 2023.He added that Washington was also working on a deal passed last year in Dubai to triple renewable power by 2030.Addressing the conference in Baku on Tuesday, UN Secretary General Guterres decried “doubling down on fossil fuels”."The sound you hear is the ticking clock," he said."We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and time is not on our side."He called 2024 a "masterclass in climate destruction" with disasters being "supercharged by human-made climate change".The UN's World Meteorological Organization previously said that 2024 is on track to be the world's warmest year on record.Guterres said "a new finance goal" was needed, with wealthiest countries paying the most."They are the largest emitters, with the greatest capacities and responsibilities," he said."Developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed."The Azerbaijani president's comments are unlikely to derail talks behind the scenes, which are largely about getting more cash for poorer countries to help implement their climate plans.Developing nations are calling for richer countries to agree together on a fund that could add up to $1 trillion, using public and private money.Leaders of most of the world's biggest polluters were not present in Baku, including Biden, France’s leader Emmanuel Macron and India’s Narendra Modi.The environment minister for Burkino Faso, a central African country among the poorest in the world, told the BBC that more cash was essential.Roger Baro said it would help his nation deal with the current impacts of climate change in the country, which is experiencing widespread drought, flash floods and disease outbreaks.The disasters occurred in the Sahel region, which saw temperatures of 45C this year in a heatwave that scientists said would have been impossible to reach without climate change.Among other world leaders to take to the stage on Tuesday was Spain's prime minister, who called for "drastic measures" after floods killed more than 200 people in the country.Experts say that climate change contributed to the heavy rainfall that caused the floods."We need to undergo decarbonisation, adapt our towns and infrastructure," said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.COP29 is scheduled to last until 22 November, but there are already fears that the tricky issues on the table could make a final agreement very difficult.It hoped to provide direct flights to destinations like the east coast of America and the Middle East.After being absent for more than a century, salmon have been spotted in Oregon's Klamath River Basin, following a mammoth dam removal project in California.The international centre, opening on Monday, will focus on sharing knowledge and providing training.The new deal offers $300bn (about £240) a year to developing nations by 2035.The Samoan chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States explains why some of developing nations left the talks in Baku.

CONTENT: FROMBy Rosemary WestwoodAmanda Zurawski (middle) and Kaitlyn Joshua (right) have been sharing their personal stories of being denied abortion care. While campaigning for Democrats as part of the Reproductive Freedom bus tour, they appeared on the Aug. 14 show Political Connections with host Ybeth Bruzual (left) in Orlando, FL.If the US Supreme Court had not overturned Roe v. Wade, Nancy Davis and Kaitlyn Joshua might never have met, or become public figures.But within weeks of the ban taking effect in 2022, both women were denied abortion care in their home state of Louisiana.This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News.Ever since, they have been talking about their frightening and fraught experiences, joining a new wave of women willing to publicly share their medical experiences, and wielding a new kind of political power.Dozens of women have been speaking out loud what many previously had kept private. As part of the fight for abortion rights, many of them have been campaigning across the country for politicians — especially Vice President Kamala Harris — and participating in media interviews, political rallies, protests and lawsuits.It’s an open question, but some believe their stories and the reproductive rights issue could change election outcomes — both at the federal level, and in states, including those considering ballot initiatives on abortion rights.In the summer of 2022, Nancy Davis, already a mother of two girls, was expecting her third child. In late July, when she was 10 weeks pregnant, her doctors in Baton Rouge told her the fetus was developing without a skull. It’s called acrania, and is always fatal for the fetus.But Louisiana had banned nearly all abortions on Aug. 1, and after that, Davis’s doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy.Nancy Davis (left) with her daughter Summer, and Kaitlyn Johsua during a Free & Just event for reproductive freedom in New Orleans, LA, on Oct. 14, 2024.Davis was devastated, and then she took a dramatic next step, one that has become increasingly common since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe in the Dobbs case. She went public.Davis emailed a local TV station in Baton Rouge, and started giving interviews to other local, and then national, news outlets.Davis soon hired a civil rights lawyer and held a press conference on the steps of the Louisiana capitol, calling on state lawmakers to change the law. Her goal was to save other women from hearing the message the doctors had given her: “Basically they said I had to carry my baby, to bury my baby,” Davis said.Even with all this publicity, it took Davis several weeks to gather enough money to travel to New York to end her pregnancy. Through it all, she continued to speak out, even appearing on the Dr. Phil show.“I knew if I was going through it, other people was going through it as well,” Davis told NPR.While Davis was talking to the media, another Baton Rouge woman, Kaitlyn Joshua, was beginning her own slow-motion collision with the new state law. It was early September 2022, and Joshua was 11 weeks pregnant with her second child. She was busy getting ready for her daughter’s fourth birthday, when she started miscarrying.She was in excruciating pain, and bleeding so much that her husband feared for her life.Over the course of two days, Joshua went to two different emergency rooms seeking abortion care to empty her uterus and complete the miscarriage. This would lessen the bleeding and pain.But Louisiana’s abortion ban had only been in effect for six weeks, so doctors refused to perform a D&C procedure or prescribe medications for the miscarriage. Joshua ended up miscarrying at home, with only her family’s support, in pain and frightened for her health.Joshua remembered seeing Davis telling her story in the news. She was inspired to go public as well. She spoke at a state health department hearing on Louisiana’s abortion ban, and later told her story to NPR and then to other prominent outlets.Joshua and Davis met at an abortion rights rally in 2023 and became friends.They lean on each other for support, especially when testifying against anti-abortion laws in Louisiana’s legislature capitol, which is 76% male, majority white, and comprised of a supermajority of anti-abortion Republicans.Both Davis and Joshua began traveling with President Biden’s re-election campaign, and later switched to campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris. Both women attended the 2023 State of the Union address.Joshua appeared in a television campaign ad for Biden. She was also one of several women who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, sharing traumatic stories about how the Dobbs decision had harmed their pregnancy care.“No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have,” Joshua told the convention crowd and millions of voters watching from home. “They write to me, saying, ‘What happened to you, happened to me.’”The convention also featured two Texas women who sued their state after being denied abortions — Kate Cox, denied care after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis, and Amanda Zurawski, who became septic after doctors refused to provide miscarriage care.Kaitlyn Joshua and her son, Liam, pose with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff during a rally for then-candidate President Joe Biden in Clawson, Michigan on June 24, 2024.Another speaker was Anya Cook, a Florida patient who lost half her blood volume after she was denied abortion care and began miscarrying in a bathroom.There have been many more patients with similar stories going public over the last two years. And those stories have helped shape the election in new ways.On November 5, voters in 10 states will decide whether to add abortion rights to their state constitutions.Depending on the outcomes, areas of the South and Midwest could experience dramatic reversals after two years of extremely rigid bans on abortion.Vice President Harris is counting on support for abortion rights to help lead her to victory, and has promised to sign any federal bill that Congress might pass restoring abortions.Republicans, sensing the political headwinds, have toned down aggressive anti-abortion messaging.Former President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages, boasting about appointing the three Supreme Court Justices who helped overturn Roe, while also claiming his second term would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.”Preliminary political research indicates that women like Davis and Joshua, telling their own personal stories, are reaching voters.These stories have proliferated. A study from the University of California at San Francisco of major newspaper coverage found that just one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, 20% of stories about abortion included a patient’s personal experience — up from just 4% as recently as 2018.These stories often feature women with wanted pregnancies who were denied medical care, said one of the study authors, Katie Woodruff.“Certainly the general public did not expect an abortion ban to be affecting basic maternal health,” she said.One poll found women voters rank abortion as their number two priority this election cycle, just a few points behind the economy.Over three-quarters of women want abortion legal in all or most cases, another survey found. Even in swing states, majorities of both Democrats and Republicans told pollsters they support abortion rights.Nancy Davis rests for a moment with her daughters Asia (left) and Starr (in arms) inside the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom tour bus on Sept. 23, 2024 in Michigan.Harvard professor Robert Blendon cautioned that voters often say they support certain policies, but that support hasn’t always dictated who they end up voting for.But this year, there are some signals that the new cadre of abortion storytellers could be turning surging support for abortion rights into actual votes.Tresa Undem, a pollster with PerryUndem, said her surveys show that voters who have heard stories like Davis and Joshua’s, when compared to those who haven't, are more likely to say the state of abortion rights will affect who they cast their ballot for in 2024.The shift was particularly striking among independents who favor abortion rights: 73% who heard those stories said the abortion issue will affect which candidate they vote for.But for those who hadn’t heard such stories, only 21% said the abortion issue would affect who they vote for.Undem added that despite the rising media coverage, Republicans are less likely to have heard the stories of women denied care.Advocates in Florida, one of the 10 states with an abortion rights measure on the November ballot, have made these stories central to their advertising and messaging.The campaign is featuring the stories of women such as Cook and Shanae Smith-Cunningham, two Floridians who were each denied care after their waters broke early in pregnancy. Canvassers for the “Yes on 4” campaign bring them up every time they knock on a voter’s door.“Our hope is that those stories are so impactful that they remember when they are in the ballot booth,” said Natasha Sutherland, the communications director for the "Yes on 4" campaign.Organizers who recently won abortion rights ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan told NPR that personal stories were key to getting out the vote.“That's what actually drives it home for people and makes them realize, ‘Wow, I need to get to the polls to do this, because there's somebody out there in my town, in my community, maybe in my family, that's counting on me to take this action,’” said Gabriel Mann, who worked as the communications director for Ohioans for Reproductive Rights, the group that passed Issue 1 establishing abortion rights in 2023.Nicole Wells Stallworth, one of the leaders of Michigan’s Proposal 3 in 2022, said the campaign leaned into abortion stories after internal polling showed just how effective it was.She said ads featuring women’s personal stories increased support for the proposal by an average of 5.7%. With moderate voters the shift was even greater: 6.9%.All that data underline what Davis and Joshua say they have experienced routinely after telling their stories: people change their minds.Joshua has spoken to Black conservative Christians about her story, and then heard them preach from the pulpit about the need for abortion care, she said. Davis’s own mother, who used to oppose abortion rights, now supports them, Davis said.“People even say ‘You know, I've crossed over.’ Or, like, ‘Now I'm pro-choice, or, like, you made me change my way of thinking,” Davis said.Nancy Davis (right) at her baby shower in Baton Rouge, LA on Apr. 28, 2024. Her friend and fellow activist Kaitlyn Joshua (left) came to celebrate, along with her infant son Liam, and daughter Lauryn.Speaking out can attract strong political blowback and online harassment.After Joshua spoke at the Democratic National Convention, Louisina’s Attorney General posted on X that “Democrats have their facts wrong.”Davis has found anti-abortion groups commenting on her story and suggesting that her fetus could have somehow lived without a skull.Both women went on to have healthy pregnancies after their medical experiences being denied abortions.Joshua now has a one-year-old son. Davis’s daughter, her third, was born in the spring.Both continue to travel for the Harris campaign, children in tow, while juggling their jobs and other commitments.Joshua was recently named one of the Women of the Year by Glamour magazine.One question Joshua keeps encountering is why she doesn’t just leave Louisiana.“And I'm like ‘No. I am a Black woman in Louisiana. My people built the state. We're gonna stay and fight for the state that we love,’” Joshua said.“And I just think that says so much more.”This story comes from NPR’s health reporting partnership with WWNO and KFF Health News.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: And how to stop itProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Sign up for The Decision, a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.The biggest risk our democracy faces this election is whether the votes cast will even matter. Any number of scenarios could play out. Ballots could be (and in fact have already been) lit on fire, or the courts could intervene to throw out votes. But the possibility we should fear the most is the one we still have a chance to prevent: the United States Congress overturning the election.Donald Trump in 2020 and early 2021 tried to use Congress to do just this, but he also tried so much else that remembering the details is hard. The details, however, are important. Trump’s desperation after losing the election led him to push to disallow votes everywhere he could—browbeating state legislatures, local election boards, state courts, federal courts, and ultimately the U.S. Congress on January 6. It all failed spectacularly, but that was an amateur effort, and one that would have required near-perfect execution to succeed. Joe Biden had won 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232, meaning that Trump would have had to overturn the results in several states to become president.This time, the election results might be closer. A tight margin would allow Trump to play in all of the same fora as last time, and now with people who have spent years developing the art of the steal. Even if Trump loses every court case, every attempt to persuade a state governor or state legislature to toss out the popular vote, and every maneuver to try to pressure state and local officials, he may yet use Congress as a backup plan.Tyler Austin Harper: Of course Black men are drifting toward TrumpThis is, I suspect, the “big secret” Trump mentioned this week, with a grin, to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. It’s a secret only because Trump wants to keep it in his back pocket, but it may be quite similar to what he attempted last time. Under laws passed by Congress, including the Electoral Count Act and the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act, here’s what is supposed to happen:Congress’s 2022 Reform Act was intended to reduce opportunities for mischief, but even so, mischief may yet emerge. For example, what does “lawfully certified” mean? If Trump claims that undocumented immigrants voted in a state, does that mean the state’s vote was not “lawfully certified”? What about claims that absentee ballots were wrongly counted? Or that ballots arrived late?The answer to all of these is an unequivocal no. Lawfully certified has long had a much more precise and technical meaning about procedure—simply whether the state’s governor has certified the vote. That narrowness has led some to say that there is nothing to fear, especially because Congress has tightened the rules in the 2022 act and made it harder for Congress to second-guess election results. I very much hope that’s right. It should be right. It is right. But we are living in a world where the whole enterprise and meaning of law is contested, and where politicians stretch laws past their breaking point. James Madison warned us about this in The Federalist Papers, calling law a mere “parchment barrier.” This time, the parchment may not hold.Here’s how the nightmare scenario could play out. Imagine the election puts Kamala Harris in the lead, with 277 to Trump’s 261 votes. Further imagine that part of that lead comes from Pennsylvania. And then imagine that Pennsylvania decides to count mail-in ballots that are missing the required handwritten date on the envelope. Trump then challenges that practice, claiming that the Pennsylvania legislature has set rules that forbid counting those ballots. He goes through the Pennsylvania courts, all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which rejects his challenge and allows the ballots to be counted. Trump then goes to the U.S. Supreme Court, which also rejects his challenge.Although that should be the end of the madness, it may not be. On January 6, one-fifth of the House and one-fifth of the Senate can claim that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acted improperly by counting these ballots, in defiance of state law. They can assert that they have the right to interpret the law independently, and that Pennsylvania has acted lawlessly. The good news here is that Congress in 2022 foreclosed that independent congressional-determination route, and said that court decisions are binding on Congress when it acts on January 6. But there is room for tendentious arguments about what Congress actually legislated, and some (including Senator Ted Cruz) have already said they believe that the 2022 act is unconstitutional. So despite Congress’s very strong 2022 efforts in this regard, an unprincipled House and Senate could try to assert these powers. The assertion of such powers would be bogus, but a debate on the floor would then ensue, and if a raw majority of the House and Senate sustain the objection—no matter how specious it is—Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes would be struck, leaving 258 electoral votes for Harris and 260 for Trump. Trump would then be declared the president.Such a decision could and should be contested in court, and challenged all the way to the United States Supreme Court, where the challenge should win. Congress would be defying the parts of the 2022 law that tightly restricted the types of objections, as well as provisions in the law that make court determinations conclusive on Congress. The question is, if Congress acts lawlessly, what will the Supreme Court do about it? Some are pointing to the Court’s recent decision to permit Virginia to strike 1,600 individuals from the voting rolls as evidence of its politicization, but defenders of the Court can point to the fact that it stayed out of the mischief in 2020, with hopes that it will act responsibly again in this go-round. The situations are, however, different. The 2020 request was on the part of the mischief makers, asking for the Court to affirmatively intervene in Trump’s favor—something the Court was apparently loath to do. This time, nonintervention favors Trump. The Court can say it is acting neutrally by not hearing the case and, by doing so, effectively hand the presidency to Trump in defiance of the will of the people.Read: The Democratic theory of winning with lessThe Supreme Court, of course, is fully capable of realizing the difference between affirmatively intervening in 2020 (where it was being asked to facilitate Trump’s theft of the election) and 2024 (where it would be asked to prevent such a thing). A decision to stay out in the face of congressional lawlessness should be unthinkable. And let us hope that it is (recall the Court just last year in Moore v. Harper rejected, by a 6–3 vote, a Republican Party theory that would have given it an immense advantage in federal elections). But just in case, one important thing must be done to prevent this nightmare from unfolding: vote.If as a result of the vote on November 5, Harris claims a decisive victory in the Electoral College, then there is little to fear, much as Trump might try to fight it. And even if the Electoral College is close, remember that Americans also vote for the House and the Senate on November 5. And the new House and Senate, not the existing ones, will make all of the decisions outlined above on January 6, 2025. If the Democrats control the House, or hold the Senate, this divided government will prevent the nightmare scenario from coming to fruition. And even if the Republicans control both houses in 2025, electing people who will honor the language and purpose of the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act—which, again, was written to prevent this scenario—will put an end to the madness.So when you vote, vote for candidates who will ensure that the will of the people will govern. James Madison in “Federalist No. 55” reminds us that the “degree of depravity in mankind … requires a certain degree of … distrust,” but “there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.” Republican government, Madison went on, depends on the latter. Let us pray that those qualities lead Americans to the polls on Tuesday and, once there, that they vote to protect our democracy.More StoriesInvestigate ThemRoger Stone Can Be Tried, Again

Subscribe to NPR's Politics Newsletter and check out NPR's live blog for more election updates and analysis.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Erie, Pa., on July 29.Former President Donald Trump has been elected president again, according to a race call by the Associated Press. Trump won the key states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with a combined 29 electoral votes to clinch more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. As of 6:15 a.m. ET Wednesday, Trump had 277 electoral votes total. Several states, including Michigan, Arizona and Nevada are still outstanding.

Prior to the race call for Wisconsin, Trump spoke at Palm Beach Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he stood flanked by family and staff and spoke to a crowd of supporters. “We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.

Trump said he won the popular vote, but those results have not been tabulated.

He will return to the White House after falsely claiming the 2020 election was rigged and stoking the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. He is also the first convicted felon to win the White House.

Republicans have retaken the Senate. They could very well have in the neighborhood of 55 to 56 Senate seats when all the counting is done. The House will not be determined for some time. It could take a week or so, as there are many close races. Sixty-two seats remain uncalled at this hour. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take control of the House. It appears they may come very close. But whoever wins control will do so by a very small margin.

— by Domenico Montanaro, NPR's political editor/correspondentNow that Republicans have reclaimed a Senate majority, Trump will have the opportunity to appoint more judges and increase his influence over the courts.

CONTENT: A big event should prompt big feelings.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Americans are anxious about the election. The American Psychological Association’s annual Stress in America survey found that, as of August, politics was the leading cause of stress for seven out of 10 adults across party lines. In a poll from a mental-health-care company the same month, 79 percent of respondents reported that the presidential election made them feel anxious this year, and more than half thought about the election every day. Now that the election is imminent, one can only assume that Americans’ anxiety is even higher.Many U.S. media outlets have responded by offering their readers advice on how to calm down. Type election anxiety into Google, and you’ll find dozens of articles instructing you to focus on aspects of life outside of politics, to spend less time watching the news, or to use relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises to subdue the negative feelings.But there’s another way to think about election stress: A big event should prompt big feelings. The stakes of this election go far beyond anyone’s preferred party winning or losing. “Voters on both sides of the aisle are being given a message that if the other side wins, this will be the end of American democracy as they know it,” Andrew Civettini, a political scientist at Knox College, told me. Why wouldn’t you feel anxious?In Western philosophy and psychology, emotions have long been cast as the opposite of reason. In Stoicism, emotions are considered “non-reasoning movements,” wild inner beasts that a person has to keep in check in order to live well. During the Enlightenment, reason was widely considered a better guiding force than the senses or the emotions. This notion occasionally rears its head in cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches patients that feelings aren’t facts, so that they can act despite their anxiety or insecurity. This week, Arianna Huffington argued in Time magazine that Americans shouldn’t be stressed out by polls. “The way to best affect outcomes is to find the eye of the hurricane, and act from that place of inner strength and wisdom,” she wrote.But political emotions motivate action all the time. “When we experience anxiety about politics, it causes us to pay more attention, and that could have positive learning effects,” Civettini said. Steven Webster, a political scientist at Indiana University, has found that political anger can push people to vote and donate to campaigns. People can, Webster told me, get too emotional about politics: Too much anger, anxiety, or fear might motivate people to support political violence, or isolate themselves from any person or news source that doesn’t confirm their beliefs. But overall, he said, “it’s not obvious to me that we should want to reduce political emotions.”Although emotions, with their heat and urgency, can overtake and weaken people, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum has argued that they reflect inner judgments and evaluations—in other words, that they are reasonable and intelligent responses to real-world events. For example, to have fear, as Nussbaum wrote in her book Upheavals of Thought, “I must believe that bad events are impending; that they are not trivially, but seriously bad; and that I am not entirely in control of warding them off.” In this way, Nussbaum noted, emotions—not some mythic, unemotional source of rationality—reveal what we require to live well and flourish.Throughout history, major political shifts have been met with equally big feelings, says Kerstin Maria Pahl, a historian of political emotion at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and a co-editor of the 2022 book Feeling Political. Apathy, a longstanding Christian concept, became part of Western political language at the end of the 18th century. “Not being affected by something made you a bad person, because you didn’t take any interest in the common good of mankind, or welfare of humanity,” Pahl told me.Allowing so much emotional interest to go unchecked might sound counterintuitive in 21st-century America, where cultural forces and psychological experts teach that emotions must be regulated for optimal well-being. But election anxiety highlights what emotions are for: to reveal what we care about, and what our moral values are. Thomas Szanto, a political philosopher at the University of Flensburg, in Germany, told me that many Americans’ political emotions are fitting responses to the election cycle. “There is something at stake for people,” Szanto said. Earlier this year, Szanto and his colleague Ruth Rebecca Tietjen argued in a paper that a political emotion is appropriate if it is functional—for example, if it pushes people to vote or seek out information about candidates—and if it has a moral component that mirrors a person’s concerns about their world, and their sense of right and wrong. Anxiety is an appropriate response from a voter who believes that Donald Trump is a threat to reproductive rights, which would violate their moral belief in bodily autonomy. Similarly, a voter who believes that abortion is murder would have a fitting emotional reaction to the idea that a Kamala Harris presidency would lead to more access to abortions.In Philip K. Dick’s 1968 dystopian novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, people can conjure any emotion they want through the use of a machine called the “mood organ.” When Iran Deckard, the wife of bounty hunter Rick Deckard, programs for herself a six-hour “self-accusatory depression,” Rick asks why she would subject herself to that when she could feel anything else. She replies that it feels wrong to not respond emotionally to the ongoing calamities in their world. “That used to be considered a sign of mental illness; they called it ‘absence of appropriate affect,’” she tells Rick.Americans in 2024 don’t need a mood organ to feel any variety of negative emotion in response to this election. They are feeling anxiety, sadness, and dread, all on their own. Surviving the remaining days until November 5 requires not simply turning off those emotions, but paying attention to what they are telling us.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

n a letter to his wife, Olga, the playwright and political dissident Václav Havel wrote, “Hope is a dimension of the spirit. It is not outside us, but within us.” Havel sent the note from a Prague jail, after being imprisoned for criticizing his country’s regime from 1979 until 1983.Havel could have been forgiven for rejecting hope. After the Prague Spring, a brief period of political protest and social liberalization, Czechoslovakia had veered back towards Soviet rule.  Authoritarians had tightened their grip on law, media, and culture, Havel forced to survey it all from a tiny cell. Some Americans might feel that the current moment runs parallel with Havel’s, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election to a second term as President. Many Democrats have abandoned hope in favor of cynicism: deciding that most of the voting public are selfish, bigoted enemies of democracy.This is an understandable response, but perhaps not a helpful one. Writing off vast swaths of Americans fuels trends most of the nation abhors. Research finds that people who mistrust their fellow citizens are most likely to support “strong man” leaders who promise to protect people while stripping away their freedoms. Donald Trump capitalized on this phenomenon, offering a fever dream of American carnage that beguiled many people into his camp. For instance, violent crime has been declining across the U.S. for decades, but many Americans—especially if they watch conservative media—falsely believe it’s on the rise. People who held that dark view favored Trump by more than 25 points. It’s not just crime. According to the Pew Research Center, Americans’ faith in institutions—including education, science, and government—has plummeted, but this drop is steepest among Republicans.The 2024 U.S. election reflected deep cynicism among voters about the nation and where it was headed. And if you are disheartened by the outcome, you might reasonably fear where we’re headed now.Read More: Your Cynicism Isn’t Helping AnybodyOptimism—the idea that things will turn out well—could feel ridiculous with all that’s happening. But what Havel knew, even while sitting in his cell, is that hope is different: the idea that things could improve. It acknowledges that we have no idea how the future will unfold—and in that uncertainty, our actions still matter.We have stereotyped hope as naive, privileged, even toxic: sticking our fingers in our ears and tuning out the world’s problems. It’s nothing of the sort. Centuries ago, philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas described hope as a struggle to reach goals that are “arduous and difficult to obtain”—hardly a walk in the park. Modern psychologists have followed suit, describing hope as a bulwark against despair in difficult times.So how does it work? And more importantly, how can it be used to affect change in our lives and across our culture?Hope contains three experiences. First, a goal, something positive that may or may not occur in the future. Second, will power, the desire to achieve that goal, and third, way power, a path through which to pursue it. Where an optimist might sit and wait for a bright future to arrive, a hopeful person pulls themselves towards it, often through great effort. And because of that, hope—more than optimism—predicts people’s ability to meet their goals.If you’re upset by this year’s election, you can use hope in at least two ways. First, it can steady your well being. Research finds that hopeful people are more resilient when facing difficulties, such as chronic illness and loss. Amid a swirl of experiences we can’t control, hope focuses us on what we can. Restoring a sense of agency, it can bring peace, purpose, and strength.This is not merely an exercise in wellness. The energy hope provides has been a cornerstone of social movements around the world and throughout history. Psychologists have examined decades of research collective action, people’s willingness to struggle together for causes in which they believe. One of the forces that most propelled collective action was a sense of efficacy. People fight when they imagine the fight could be won. In other words, when they feel hope.One source of efficacy—and hope—among activists is the knowledge that even when systems are unjust and harmful, most people are not. After his release from prison, Havel got right back into the advocacy that had gotten him arrested in the first place. But he was not alone. His dissident group, Charter 77, led national strikes and demonstrations that swelled to hundreds of thousands of people. With the media under state control, citizens hung handmade protest signs from their windows. Each risked their safety, but also signaled to each other how popular the movement was.  Within a few years, the regime had toppled, and Havel became the Czech Republic’s first President.  Now, too, good citizens are everywhere. Conservative voters are wrong about crime statistics, but both sides misunderstand each other. Research clearly demonstrates that more than 80% of Americans—including Democrats and Republicans voters—would prefer greater peace between political parties; most respect democratic rule. Across surveys, a supermajority of the country support policies to protect poor people and the climate. But almost no one knows that. Both Democrats and Republicans vastly overestimate how extreme, hateful, anti-democratic, and violent their opponents are. Media companies thrive on outrage, inundating us with extreme and inflammatory portrayals of the “other side.” When we uncritically consume these messages, we miss out on vast swaths of common ground that most Americans share.  Succumbing to cynicism might feel like a balm after this election, but it’s a trap—one that leads us further from the solutions we need. Instead, we must embrace the hard work of hope: recognizing our shared humanity, seeking common ground, and building a coalition that transcends divides. This isn’t wishful thinking; it’s strategic, deliberate, and essential.In their walk through the wilderness, Democrats will need to consider how to build a broader coalition that can defeat the cynical populism of Trump and his successors. In this mission, hope isn’t just a mindset—it’s the plan.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: By Tamara Keith, Barbara SpruntPresident Biden shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office on Nov. 13, 2024.Former and future President Donald Trump met with Republicans in Congress and visited his old office today, the Oval Office, making his first trip to Washington since winning the presidential election.President Biden invited his predecessor and successor for what is a ceremonial tradition meant to signal the desire for a smooth and peaceful transfer of power.In a very brief photo-op at the beginning of a meeting that lasted almost two hours, the leaders shook hands and Biden congratulated Trump and said he looked forward to a smooth transition.Trump said: "It will be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.""Politics is tough and in many cases it's not a nice world, but it is a nice world today," Trump said.The leaders had "substantive" private discussions with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and Susie Wiles, who will have the job when Trump takes office in January, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.Biden said Trump was "gracious" and "came with a detailed set of questions," Jean-Pierre said, declining to go into details about what was on that list. The leaders discussed the government funding bill that Congress needs to pass by Dec. 21, and disaster aid funding after this fall's hurricanes, Jean-Pierre said."The length of the meeting tells you that they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues," she said."This is not about President Biden or President-elect Trump. This is about the American people, and what's right for the American people," Jean-Pierre said.Biden made the case to Trump that it's in the U.S. national security interest to continue to stand with Ukraine in its war with Russia, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. Trump and many of his aides have expressed skepticism about U.S. aid to Ukraine.First lady Jill Biden was there to greet Trump on his arrival, the White House told reporters, giving him a handwritten letter for Melania Trump, who did not attend.House Speaker Mike Johnson welcomes President-elect Donald Trump at a House Republicans Conference meeting at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill on Nov. 13, 2024.Trump started his day in Washington with a visit to a hotel ballroom where House Republicans were meeting to select their new slate of leaders. Trump was met with a standing ovation and lengthy cheers as he was joined on stage by Wiles and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk who has become a close adviser.Republican House members leaving the morning conference were in high spirits, describing a celebratory atmosphere in the room where Trump thanked them for their support."He's on fire," said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. "The agenda he's putting forward is unbelievable."Trump broadly laid out his vision for top priorities for his administration — including continuing to build a wall along the southern border."It was like, 'We're going to move fast, hang together, be a team' — kind of a rah-rah address, which is about what I expected," said Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole. "It's not the place to lay out a policy agenda, and he certainly didn't do that."Instead, Trump focused on unifying a party that has been hampered by infighting and chaos for the past several years as they fought Biden and Democrats in divided government.The mood has shifted dramatically as Republicans prepare for unified control in Washington. Several important House races are still outstanding but Republicans are on track to secure a narrow majority in that chamber after winning a 53-47 majority in the Senate.President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump hold a brief photo op at the start of their meeting in the Oval Office on Nov. 13, 2024.In 2020, Trump refused to accept the results of the election and did not invite Biden to the Oval Office.But in 2016, then-President Barack Obama sat next to Trump in the Oval Office just two days after Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.In this file photo from Nov. 10, 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump listens to then-President Barack Obama speak after their Oval Office meeting.Sitting side by side, Trump called Obama a "very good man," said it was an honor to meet with him and expressed surprise that the conversation had lasted more than an hour.The one piece of advice Obama gave Trump while reporters were in the room was, "Don't answer the questions when they just start yelling it."That's something Trump immediately ignored when in office. He frequently held court as reporters shouted questions, responding to the ones he felt like answering and sometimes sparring with the journalists.But on Wednesday, both Trump and Biden ignored reporters' questions.Biden campaigned against Trump twice, winning in 2020 with an argument that Trump was an existential threat to U.S. democracy.Then during the 2024 campaign, their one meeting on a debate stage in late June essentially ended Biden's bid for a second term. During the remaining months of the campaign Trump often gloated about his knock-out punch in the debate and bemoaned the "coup" that forced Biden out of the race.But, the day after the election, Biden phoned Trump to congratulate him and invited him to the White House for a meeting."I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition," Biden told staff and members of his cabinet gathered in the Rose Garden last week. "That's what the American people deserve."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.The 62-year-old's nomination on Friday evening kicked-off a series of cabinet announcements and White House appointments that leaves Trump's top team almost complete ahead of his return to the presidency in January."Scott is widely respected as one of the World’s foremost International Investors and Geopolitical and Economic Strategists," Trump said in his announcement on Truth Social."[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda," he said, adding that Bessent would "support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances."Bessent has made it well known that he wants to extend tax cuts made in Mr Trump's first term in office.He has also defended the use of import tariffs, one of the more controversial parts of the President-elect's campaign agenda, calling them a "useful negotiating tool".On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a "new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes".Trump also nominated Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for US Labor Secretary on Friday, saying she would help to "grow wages and improve working conditions [and] bring back our manufacturing jobs".The representative from Oregon, 56, won strong trade union support but narrowly lost her bid for re-election earlier this month, meaning her nomination will not affect the Republican majority in the House come January.He then made another cabinet nomination moments later, announcing Scott Turner as his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NFL veteran and motivational speaker previously served in the Texas House of Representatives.Trump also announced a series of senior health picks, giving his backing to Fox News contributor Dr Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General and former Florida Congressman Dr Dave Weldon as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).He selected Russell Vought as director of the US Office of Management and Budget, which helps decide policy priorities and how they should be funded.Vought, who played a role in Project 2025 - a "wish list" for a second Trump presidency by the conservative Heritage Foundation - held the same position during Trump's first term.The president-elect also announced White House roles for Alex Wong and Sebastian Gorka who also served during Trump's first term.If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term.Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.Such ideas have been met with alarm in traditional economic and corporate circles.In an interview with Fox News shortly before the election, Bessent said ensuring the tax cuts do not expire as planned at the end of next year would be his top priority, if he ended up in the administration."If it doesn’t happen, this will be the largest tax increase in US history," he warned.For other posts, Trump has been willing to back candidates with minimal experience in favour of loyalty and apparent conviction in his pledges.But he has appeared more hesitant to buck convention at the Treasury Department, which serves as a key liaison between the White House and Wall Street and has critical functions that include collecting taxes, supervising banks, wielding sanctions and handling US government debt.In his announcement, Trump said Bessent would “help curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt”. That issue has long been a priority for traditional Republicans, but financial markets see an increase in debt as a risk in a second Trump term.Bessent, a native of South Carolina, made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.In 2015, he started his own fund, Key Square Capital Management, which is known for making investments based on big-picture economic policy.He and his husband, a former New York City prosecutor, married in 2011 and have two children. He is known for philanthropy in South Carolina, where his family has deep roots.Bessent has defended tariffs - a capstone of Trump's protectionist agenda - arguing that opposition to them is rooted in political ideology and not "considered economic thought".But he has also characterised Trump’s support for such border taxes as a negotiating tool, suggesting the president-elect isn’t necessarily committed to aggressively raising duties.That stance makes him more moderate than others whose names were floated for the treasury role.However, Bessent has been a strong proponent of Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Such support would make him the first treasury secretary to openly champion cryptocurrency, sending a clear signal that Trump is serious about establishing the US as the "crypto capital of the planet".Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.Ever since two young men were jailed for killing their wealthy parents in 1989, the case has gripped the US.Ryan Kobayashi died after travelling in search of his daughter, who has been missing since early November.

ice President Kamala Harris formally conceded in a speech Wednesday afternoon at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she urged her followers to continue fighting for democracy. Former President Donald Trump will be serving a second term after he was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election early Wednesday by the Associated Press.The following transcript was prepared and provided to TIME by Rev, using AI-powered software, and it was reviewed and edited for accuracy by TIME staff.-Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good—Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, good afternoon. Thank you all.Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So let me say (crowd screams love you), and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials I thank you. I thank you all. Look, I am so proud of the race we ran. And the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign—the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways: in how we live our lives by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor, by always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But, like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. And the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it.  To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look, many of you know I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives.  People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage a historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. Make God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. I thank you all. CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Election officials are under siege.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.When melissa kono, the town clerk in Burnside, Wisconsin, began training election workers in 2015, their questions were relatively mundane. They asked about election rules, voter eligibility, and other basic procedures. The job was gratifying and enjoyable; they helped their neighbors while sipping coffee.But over the past few years, everything has changed. Kono now finds herself fielding questions about what to do when approached by suspicious voters who ask provocative questions or gripe about fraud. She’s added an entire training section dedicated to identifying threats and how to report them. “I never in a million years imagined that that would be part of my curriculum,” she told me. Kono has yet to receive any direct threats herself—perhaps, she thinks, because Donald Trump won the popular vote in her area in 2016 and 2020—but she fears that things may be different this time around. “What I do hear is I know the election is not rigged here, but in other places,” she said. “And I’m honestly worried sometimes: What if Harris wins? What if it gets too close? And now they start questioning me or coming after me, when I have nothing to do with the outcome.”Around the country, election officials have already received death threats and packages filled with white powder. Their dogs have been poisoned, their homes swatted, their family members targeted. In Texas, one man called for a “a mass shooting of poll workers and election officials” in precincts with results he found suspicious. “The point is coercion; the point is intimidation. It’s to get you to do or not do something,” Al Schmidt, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, told me—to get you to “stop counting votes, or we’re going to murder your children, and they name your children,” a threat that Schmidt said he received in 2020. This year, the same things may well happen again. “I had one election official who said they called her on her cellphone and said, ‘Looks like your mom made lasagna tonight; she’s wearing that pretty yellow dress that she likes to wear to church,” Tammy Patrick, the chief programs officer at the National Association of Election Officials and a former elections officer in Maricopa County, Arizona, told me. “It’s terrorism here in America.”These workers, from secretaries of state to local officials to volunteers, are bearing the immediate, human toll of a campaign to discredit the integrity of American democracy. They are the most direct and vulnerable targets for people who have embraced conspiracy theories about fraudulent and “stolen” votes following the 2020 election—unfounded claims that have been directly promoted by Trump and many other members of the Republican Party, who still will not accept that he lost his first reelection bid. Where candidates used to compete against each other, Schmidt told me, some are now “attacking the referees.” In the most extreme narratives, election workers are accused of fabricating, shredding, or double-counting ballots, which leads to suspicion and harassment. “Since the 2020 election, we have seen an unprecedented spike in threats against the public servants who do administer our elections,” including shootings and a bomb threat, Attorney General Merrick Garland said last month. A survey conducted in February and March by the Brennan Center for Justice found that 38 percent of election officials reported being harassed, abused, or threatened—up from 30 percent a year earlier.This is not just a story about assaults on individual workers, although that would be bad enough. Election administration is “underappreciated as the foundation upon which all of our representative government thrives,” Rachel Orey, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center Elections Project, told me. In a very real way, these officials represent the soul of democracy. Many of them are undertaking their duties while also juggling child care and everyday errands such as grocery shopping. Without their diligence, nobody could be elected, period. The form of government that Americans recognize and celebrate could not exist.Dissuading or preventing people from going to, or otherwise attempting to interfere with, the polls are century-old dirty tactics, and there are all manner of legal ways to suppress or dilute the vote, many of which target racial minorities. But Trump’s attempts to unilaterally dictate election results are different. As far back as 2012, he criticized Barack Obama’s reelection as a “total sham and a travesty.” Victory in 2016, and the conversion or defeat of nearly all of his Republican rivals, gave Trump the power to mount a serious and systematic attempt to discredit the democratic process. He and his furious supporters, in turn, have unleashed a sustained assault on national and state elections alike.“I wasn’t aware of any real threats or harassment or wide-scale verbal abuse on election officials prior to the 2020 election cycle,” Tina Barton, the vice chair of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, told me. The outrage and attacks that emerged in 2020 have now been harnessed into a well-funded campaign: Republicans have reportedly donated upwards of $100 million to a network of so-called election-integrity groups to lay the groundwork for contesting the results should Trump lose again. Although poll watching is itself normal, the GOP is training and deploying armies of monitors with the presumption of fraud, flooding election offices with public-records requests, and filing endless challenges to voter-registration records. “I don’t think there’s any question that there is a more coordinated and sophisticated effort ahead of this election to discredit it than there was in 2020,” Lawrence Norden, the vice president of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, told me.This election cycle, one of the “dominant narratives” is about noncitizen voting, Thessalia Merivaki, a political scientist at Georgetown University who studies how election officials combat misinformation, told me. Republican activists, politicians, lawmakers, and pundits have especially seized on false fears about immigrant and foreign voting to burnish a conspiracy theory that noncitizen votes from overseas will turn the election. These claims have been widely debunked, but all the energy behind them could delay vote counts and disenfranchise citizens. Republican groups are filing more and more lawsuits in battleground states about voter-identification requirements, absentee ballots, and other basic procedures, “setting up an opportunity afterwards to cast doubt on the election results,” Norden said.When I began reporting this article, I was curious about whether election officials had concerns over new technologies. The internet has changed substantially since 2020. For the past couple of years, I’ve written about the rise of generative AI and its attendant issues: In terms that are most directly relevant to the election, that means the arrival of easy-to-create and highly convincing deepfakes, the concoction of micro-targeted conspiracy theories, the overall degradation of our information environment, and the possibility that our sense of shared reality might be wiped out altogether. It’s easy to imagine that AI could wreak havoc around Election Day—earlier this year, a robocall that cloned President Joe Biden’s voice was used in a voter-suppression effort—and experts have made their concerns about the technology clear.The election workers and officials I spoke with did express worry about AI and its ability to accelerate disinformation and election-interference campaigns. But they also described problems that came from more familiar sources. They spoke with me about how videos of entirely proper and legal election procedures—snippets of livestreamed election procedures, for instance—had been miscontextualized to suggest that officials who were simply following the rules were actually smuggling in ballots, rigging voting machines, or otherwise manipulating the results. Blatantly false headlines and incendiary posts spreading on messaging apps and among social-media groups have done and continue to do plenty of damage. Sometimes, the details are irrelevant. As my colleague Charlie Warzel recently wrote, manipulated media and misinformation is useful not necessarily because it convinces some population of undecided suckers, but because it allows the already aggrieved to sequester themselves in a parallel reality. A voter might say, “Let’s just set the facts aside,” Patrick, of the National Association of Election Officials, told me, “and I’m going to tell you what I think or what I feel about this.”Amy Burgans, the clerk-treasurer in Douglas County, Nevada, herself had doubts about the outcome of the 2020 election when she started in her role that December. (The previous clerk-treasurer had resigned—the pandemic and contentious election cycle, Burgans told me, had been “a lot.”) Burgans said that she had heard in the news, on social media, and from people she knew that there “must have been” some foul play. But once she was in charge of running elections and administered the 2022 midterms, she said, she saw the rigor at every step of the process and understood that the allegations of widespread, systemic fraud were impossible.Now she’s the one fielding questions, frequently about voting machines. Burgans has explained to voters all of the controls in place, that she’s “never seen even one error” after an election audit. Still, people ask her about election procedures at almost every event she attends, or “even if I’m at the Elks Club just hanging out,” she said. Burgans said she has “no issues with” and tries to address these questions. But doing so takes time and energy—and these comments are just the tip of the spear.Burgans received a threat in the mail in 2022. Although it was mostly a broad rant about the government, it did make her worry for her children’s safety, and she installed a security system in her home. Her county’s election facilities are stocked with personal protective equipment and Narcan, in the event of suspicious substances or powders (which might be fentanyl) arriving in the mail—something that has already happened at election offices in several states. She also recently installed bulletproof glass in the office, where Burgans and full-time staff work—as a precaution rather than a response to any particular threat, she said. Election deniers are “consistently coming into [election] offices saying things like ‘You’d better watch your back’ or ‘Don’t you forget: I know where your kids go to school,” Barton, the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections vice chair, told me. What was unprecedented in 2020, Barton said, is now an “ongoing onslaught.”This attack on american elections is not an invasion so much as a siege. And just as hateful, outlandish, and conspiracist misinformation have eroded Americans’ trust in one another, institutions, and basic facts, this environment is taking a psychic toll on election workers. They find themselves having to put in extra hours to field questions, accommodate an influx of poll watchers, process voter challenges, sort through public-records requests, and prepare for any emergencies and attacks—all while fearing for their safety. For more than two decades, running an election has become steadily more complex and involved. After 2000’s infamous hanging chads, election workers had to become IT professionals. After long lines became a key issue in 2008 and 2012, they became logistics experts. After 2016, they learned cybersecurity, and in advance of 2020, they studied public-health protocols and how to process enormous quantities of mail-in ballots. Now election workers have to be communications experts as well. “We’ve had poll watchers in here every single day since September 26,” when early voting began, “sometimes three or four of them in a small space,” Aaron Ammons, the clerk and recorder of deeds in Champaign County, Illinois, said in a recent press briefing.Meanwhile, support and resources for these emerging responsibilities are frequently missing. The result, inevitably, is burnout: The job keeps getting harder and requiring more hours, but resources for hiring, buying new equipment, improving security, and more have been inconsistent and haphazard. “There have been new challenges and new expectations put on election administrators, but funding hasn’t kept pace,” Rachel Orey said. Hours spent on election work have ballooned since 2020, according to a recent national survey of election workers conducted by Reed College. Meanwhile, nearly one-third of election offices don’t have any full-time staff, wages are pitiful, and turnover rates grew from 28 percent in 2004—already high—to nearly 39 percent in 2022.This burden “has taken away from [election officials’] ability to just focus on the mechanics of that very important election,” Kim Wyman, a former secretary of state for Washington who recently served as a senior election-security adviser at the Department of Homeland Security, told me. Skeptics will use innocent mistakes and logistical snares—which are mundane and easily rectified—and even the act of correcting “as gasoline on the fire to ‘prove’ their point or their claim of voter fraud,” she said. This, in turn, only fuels the exhaustion. “People just make up stuff about what we do and are coming after us,” Kono, of Wisconsin, told me. She’s seen many longtime clerks and election workers leave, telling her, “I can’t do another presidential election” and “I don’t want to have to deal with voters.”Those who remain do not take the job lightly. In 20 years working in election administration, Barton told me, “I have never seen election officials train so much in four years’ time”—improving security, being transparent at every step of the process, speaking at events and posting on social media to educate their communities. They’ve been preparing for November 5, 2024, for four years, Wyman told me. “This is my Olympics,” Kono said.The misinformation crisis is commonly understood as a clash between two “realities” that is most visible online, in the words of high-profile politicians, or during spectacular flashpoints such as the January 6 Capitol riot. But for four years, and especially in the weeks leading up to and after November 5, these battles have and will be quotidian and interpersonal. “We are your soccer coaches. We are the moms helping at the schools, the dads coaching baseball, the grandmothers that are going on field trips,” Burgans said. This everyday warfare, waged against the neighbors and teachers and elders and bus drivers who administer the polls, and in turn democracy, may be more consequential than any single vote or outcome.More StoriesAI’s Fingerprints Were All Over the ElectionThe Great Conspiracy-Theorist Flip-Flop

CONTENT: The man accused of killing 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley has been sentenced to life in prison, in a case that became a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential election.A judge in Georgia found Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, guilty of murder and other charges related to Ms Riley's death.Prosecutors argued that Ibarra killed the student on 22 February this year after going “hunting for females” on the University of Georgia (UGA) campus.Ms Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family cried as the verdict was read. Ibarra did not visibly react.Ibarra’s lawyers had argued that evidence linking him to Ms Riley’s death was “circumstantial”.Ms Riley, who lived in the city of Athens, north-east Georgia, was found dead in a wooded area of the UGA campus after she did not return from her morning run.Ibarra was arrested a day later.On Wednesday, he was found guilty of all 10 counts, including felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury and aggravated assault with intent to rape.Ibarra had waived his right to a jury trial, which means his case was heard and decided by county Judge H Patrick Haggard.He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, as prosecutors had requested.Prosecutors told the court Ibarra saw Riley while she was running on the UGA campus and "bashed her skull in with a rock".Data from Ms Riley's smartwatch showed she had "fought for her life, fought for her dignity" only minutes after departing on her run, the trial heard.The victim's struggle was "fierce", the lead prosecutor said. Ms Riley called police at 09:11 that morning and her heart stopped at 09:28, with no more movement from her device.Ibarra's lawyer had argued there was a lack of proof connecting his client to Ms Riley's death.But prosecutors said evidence showed that Ibarra's DNA was found under the nails of Ms Riley, indicating a struggle between them.The trial, which began last Friday, included testimony from more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Ms Riley's former roommate and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.Rosbeli Flores-Bello, Ibarra's former roommate, testified that the two had travelled together from New York City, where they had been living in a migrant shelter, to Georgia in search of work.Ibarra entered the US illegally on 8 September 2022, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was later released for further processing.ICE has said that Ibarra was arrested in New York City in September 2023 and was charged with "acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation".He was released by the NYPD, ICE officials said.Ms Riley's name became a rallying cry for conservatives as border security emerged as a defining issue in the White House race.In March, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was heckled over her murder during his State of the Union address to Congress.Republican lawmakers said it was the White House's fault that Ibarra was able to remain in the country despite his criminal record.President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, often invoked Ms Riley's name on the campaign trail.Trump reacted to Ibarra's guilty verdict, writing on Truth Social that he hopes the outcome of the trial "can bring some peace and closure to her wonderful family who fought for justice"."It is time to secure our border," Trump added.A National Institute of Justice study suggests that undocumented migrants in the US are arrested for violent and drug crimes at less than half the rate of native-born citizens.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: After a bruising election, many Americans may feel an impulse toward solitude. That’s the wrong instinct.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.One month to the day before the 2024 presidential election, The New York Times reported on a new analysis of how Americans spend their time. More and more of the average American’s day is being spent at home: one hour and 39 minutes more in 2022 than in 2003. For each extra hour at home, a bit of it was spent with family—7.4 minutes. More of it, 21 minutes, was spent alone.Obviously, because of the coronavirus pandemic, time at home spiked in 2020. Some of this homebody impulse may well be the stubborn persistence of habits formed during the isolating early days of lockdown. But this trend is more than just a pandemic hangover. For years before COVID-19 hit, time spent alone had been increasing as time spent socializing had been decreasing. Though solitude and loneliness are not the same, this downturn in social connection happened alongside a rise in loneliness so pronounced that the surgeon general called it an epidemic.And now this: the reelection to the nation’s highest office of Donald Trump, a man who has attacked the very idea of a communal, democratic form of government, and who has indicated that he aspires to move the United States toward autocracy—auto, of course, meaning “self,” and autocracy being the concentration of power for and within the self. Self over others is one of Trump’s defining principles. In his first term as president, he used an office intended for public service to enrich himself. He has vowed to use it this time to take revenge on his enemies and—“within two seconds” of taking office—to fire the special counsel overseeing criminal cases against him.Yet self over others, or at the very least self before others, has long been a prominent aspect of American culture—not always to Trumpian levels, certainly, but individualism for better and worse shapes both the structure of society and our personal lives. And it will surely shape Americans’ responses to the election: for the winners, perhaps, self-congratulation; for the losers, the risk of allowing despair to pull them into a deeper, more dangerous seclusion. On Election Day, the Times published an article on voters’ plans to manage stress. Two separate people in that story said they were deliberately avoiding social settings. To extend that strategy into the next four years would be a mistake.Read: Don’t give up on AmericaIn 1831, the French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville traveled to the United States. He observed and analyzed its people and culture, and published his thoughts in a massive two-volume report called Democracy in America. Alongside his praise for the country’s professed value of equality—which he wrote “possesses all the characteristics of a divine decree”—he warned of the individualism he saw as baked into American society and the isolation it could cause. “Each man is forever thrown back on himself alone,” he wrote, “and there is danger that he may be shut up in the solitude of his own heart.”More than a century and a half later, Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life, a sociological book by five scholars, followed explicitly in Tocqueville’s footsteps, examining how individualism affects institutions and personal relationships in the United States. Published in 1985, it reads today as wildly prescient. The authors feared that the danger Tocqueville described had already come to pass. “It seems to us,” they wrote, “that it is individualism, and not equality, as Tocqueville thought, that has marched inexorably through our history. We are concerned that this individualism may have grown cancerous … that it may be threatening the survival of freedom itself.”Tempering American individualism, in Tocqueville’s view, was Americans’ propensity to form associations and participate in civic life. “These he saw as moderating the isolating tendencies of private ambition on one hand and limiting the despotic proclivities of government on the other,” the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote. But American associational life began hollowing out starting in the 1960s and ’70s, as people became less and less likely to attend any kind of club, league, church, or other community organization (a shift that Robert Putnam documented in his 2000 book, Bowling Alone). Since the late ’70s, faith in large-scale institutions such as organized religion, organized labor, the media, and the U.S. government has also been dwindling; in 2023, Gallup declared it “historically low.”A few months ago I spoke with Ann Swidler, one of the authors of Habits of the Heart. “We obviously did not succeed in having things go the direction we might have hoped,” she told me. “I would say that every horrible thing we worried about has gotten worse.” Americans are spending measurably more time shut up in the solitude of their homes, and perhaps in the solitude of their own hearts as well.It might be difficult to imagine the renaissance of many civic associations—the kind that could be good for both democracy and our relationships—given that a majority of Americans just voted for a man who has little interest in or respect for institutions beyond what they can do for him. If autocracy is indeed where the country is headed, Tocqueville’s prediction regarding our relationships is not a positive one. As he wrote in The Old Regime and the Revolution, his book on the French revolution:Despotism does not combat this tendency [toward individualism]; on the contrary, it renders it irresistible, for it deprives citizens of all common passions, mutual necessities, need of a common understanding, opportunity for combined action: it ripens them, so to speak, in private life. They had a tendency to hold themselves aloof from each other: it isolates them. They looked coldly on each other: it freezes their souls.If individualism is, as the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote, “the first language in which Americans tend to think about their lives,” it makes sense that people would reach for their mother tongue in times of upheaval. In the days after the 2016 election, for example, searches for the term self-care spiked. Caring for yourself takes different forms, of course, though in mainstream culture, self-care is commonly used to mean treating yourself, by yourself. Self-soothing, alone. (One can see in this echoes of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay “Self-Reliance”: “Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.”)But caring for yourself doesn’t always have to breed isolation. Among activists and in the helping professions, self-care is often talked about as a way to restore people so that they don’t burn out and can continue their altruistic work. Some in these circles critique a focus on self-care as distracting from the need for institutional support. But the overall conception at least shows an understanding of the two types of care as having a symbiotic relationship: Care for the self so that you can show up for others.Read: Focus on the things that matterWhat’s more, caring for others is a form of self-care. Research shows that doing things for other people leads to greater well-being than trying to make yourself happy or indulging yourself. This is not to say there is no place for self-soothing or solitude, or for buying yourself a little treat. But it is to challenge the cultural message that turtling up alone is the most appropriate response to difficult feelings.Under an administration for which (to paraphrase my colleague Adam Serwer) cruelty, not care, is the point, it falls to people to care for one another on scales small and large. This task is made harder not just by the cultural pressure for Americans to rely only on themselves but also by the slow, steady atrophying of the muscles of togetherness. “American individualism resists more adult virtues, such as care and generativity, let alone wisdom,” the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote. The inverse, I hope, is true too: that care and generativity—working to make contributions to a collective future—are the path to resisting hyper-individualism and isolation.Even if turning inward is a big-picture trend, it is, of course, not the only development happening. As isolating as the pandemic lockdown was, those years saw the rise of mutual-aid groups determined to care for the vulnerable whether the government did or not. During the first Trump administration, mass protests broke out; people fought for women’s rights and an end to racist police brutality. People are always showing up for one another in quiet, everyday ways too. Building networks of support and commitment could provide some small buffer against the effects of a self-serving president-elect’s policies while keeping people from drifting further apart.Americans’ skills of connection and care are not lost. But they are rusty. And all of us will need those skills if we are to find a way to turn toward one another instead of inward. I’m not even talking about overcoming political polarization or reaching out to build bridges with strangers who voted differently than you did. Those are tasks that people won’t be equipped to tackle if they’re struggling to show up for the loved ones already in their life. For now, it is enough of a challenge to attempt to reverse the isolationist inertia of decades. It is enough of a challenge to resist what has become a cultural tendency to withdraw, while also processing the stress of an election that has left many people exhausted and deeply afraid for the future. How do we proceed over the next four years? Not alone. How do we proceed over the next week, hour, minute? Not alone.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

CONTENT: By Bill ChappellA Pennsylvania state elector casts his vote in the 2020 presidential election in Harrisburg on Dec. 14, 2020.Every presidential election cycle, constitutional law expert Alison LaCroix can count on people asking her one question when they learn what she does for a living.“Why do we have the Electoral College?” she says she's asked — again and again. “It's good news in terms of people being aware that it exists,” says LaCroix, who teaches law and history at the University of Chicago, “but bad news in the sense that people feel like, ‘Why does it exist, and is it useful?’”A majority of Americans — more than 60% — support abolishing the Electoral College, according to a September report by the Pew Research Center. But the system has survived an unprecedented number of attempts to change it.“There have been more proposals for Constitutional amendments on changing the Electoral College than on any other subject,” according to the National Archives, citing more than 700 efforts to dismantle the process.Backers of the Electoral College idea say the system balances power among large and small states, brings stability, and is an obstacle to demagogues. But critics call the Electoral College an indirect process that’s undemocratic and rooted in racism. It’s also the reason we have swing states.“From the perspective of 2024, you know, it doesn't seem ‘small-d’ democratic to have this sort of intermediate body between the people voting and the ultimate decision,” says LaCroix, who has written a historical analysis of the U.S. Constitution.Here’s a quick guide:Dec. 16, 1940: New York State electors, part of the Electoral College, cast votes at the state capital in Albany. "All are unidentified," according to The Associated Press.“When voters cast their ballots for a candidate for president of the United States, they are actually voting for the presidential electors who were selected by that candidate’s party,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.On ballots around the country, names like “Donald Trump” and “Kamala Harris” actually represent slates of electors — members of the Electoral College who are pledged to vote for that candidate.There are 538 members of the Electoral College nationwide: one for each state’s members of Congress, and three more for the District of Columbia. That’s where the presidential election’s famous number comes from: The candidate with at least 270 electoral votes (a majority) wins. As we’ve seen in some previous elections, that candidate doesn’t have to win the popular vote.Despite its substantial-sounding name, the Electoral College is neither a place nor a permanent body: It’s more of a process. In each state, political parties designate their own slate of potential electors before the November general election.Nearly every state and the District of Columbia have a winner-take-all policy, meaning only those electors tied to a candidate who won the popular vote in their state will send their ballots to the Capitol. Maine and Nebraska divide the ballots, giving two “at-large” electoral votes to the state’s overall winner but also one for each congressional district won.The electors then gather in mid-December to cast their votes for president and vice president, sending the results to Congress.Congress then certifies the votes, on Jan. 6. If there’s a tie, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to choose the president.A presidential candidate can win the Electoral College vote but lose the popular vote: it happened in 2016 and 2000, and several times in the 1800s.In most states, the two main parties choose slates of potential electors either at their conventions or by committee votes. They’re often people who play prominent roles in state government or are longstanding party members.Each state’s legislature determines how electors are chosen — but there are two main restrictions: They can’t be federal government workers; and they can’t be members of Congress.Federal law doesn’t require electors to vote in a way that reflects that results in their state, but 37 states have laws requiring them to do so, according to the NCSL. The organization says the 2016 election saw seven “faithless” electors — including five Democratic electors who refused to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton — the most since 1972.Despite their power, electors’ identities aren’t usually widely known outside of their state. Unlike members of Congress, there isn’t a centralized list of all the states’ electors, according to the Office of the Federal Register.Jan. 6, 2021: Then-President Trump's supporters march at the Michigan State Capitol to protest the certification of Joe Biden as the next U.S. president.The country’s framers saw the Electoral College as a way to balance a lot of competing motivations, from the separation of federal powers to states not wanting to cede power, to concerns of unequal power between the states due to population differences (and for some, not wanting to risk losing slavery). LaCroix says even at the time, in the 1780s when this decision was made at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, the delegates chose “an unusual body.”The Constitution’s framers were also dubious about a popular vote, concerned on one hand that the country was too large for the public to make an informed choice on a leader — and on the other, that a direct system could help a demagogue rise to power.They also considered, but dismissed, the idea of having Congress choose the president, similar to Great Britain’s parliamentary system. But at the Convention, Gouverneur Morris — who argued for a popular vote — warned that if the legislature picked the president, “it will be the work of intrigue, of cabal, and of faction.”But some Convention attendees also believed candidates would likely fail to gain national support outside their region, leaving Congress to decide the presidency.“And then they say, well, what about an intermediate body, which becomes the Electoral College,” LaCroix says. “[It] solves the problem of the president being too beholden to Congress. It's a temporary body. It's not some entity that has ongoing power. And they thought that was appealing.”A further sign of the Electoral College’s ephemeral nature: The term isn’t mentioned in the Constitution.Dec. 13, 2000: Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore march to the Florida State Capitol to rally against the legislature's intention to name a slate of electors favorable to Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.At the Convention, Southern states successfully argued for using enslaved people’s population numbers to bolster their power in Congress, claiming that each slave should be counted as 3/5 of a person — but not have the right to vote — when calculating representation.A direct popular vote for the presidency would undermine that power. But if the Electoral College were to be based on representation in Congress, the Three Fifths Compromise’s amplification of Southern political power would carry over into choosing the president. The dynamic has been a force in presidential elections ever since.“That's a problem with the Electoral College today, is it just sort of refracts too much power to small states,” LaCroix says. “And some of it is about smaller states — or states that were, like Georgia and South Carolina, really concerned about protecting slavery” in the new Constitution.The Civil War and the 13th Amendment ended the Three Fifths era. But for decades afterward, Southern states worked to suppress and dilute Black voters’ impact. Today, the Electoral College’s critics say that its winner-take-all aspect is still harmful.“You see the impact, for example, in the South right now,” Jesse Wegman, author of the book Let The People Pick The President: The Case For Abolishing The Electoral College, told NPR’s Fresh Air in 2020. Wegman says millions of Black citizens’ votes in Southern states are simply drowned out by white majorities.“You see these patterns replicating themselves throughout our history,” he said. “The people who stopped the popular vote amendment in the late 1960s were Southern segregationists. Some of the people who prevented us from getting to a popular vote in the founding of the country were slave holders. Again and again the pattern repeats itself.”Nov. 13, 2016: Protestors demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The Republican lost the popular vote by more than a million votes, but he won the Electoral College vote.Going back more than 50 years, a majority of voters have supported doing away with the Electoral College.“Public opinion polls have shown Americans favored abolishing it by majorities of 58 percent in 1967; 81 percent in 1968; and 75 percent in 1981,” according to the National Archives.Momentum to replace the Electoral College got a boost in 1968, when Richard Nixon notched a razor-thin win of the popular vote — after earlier concerns that segregationist George Wallace’s third-party candidacy might siphon enough electoral votes to prevent a clear majority.Sen. Birch Bayh led a push to amend the Constitution, and in September of 1969, the House voted 339–70 to adopt the measure. But the amendment languished in the Senate.“Led by Southern senators but helped by some very conservative Midwestern Republicans, the proposal is defeated by a filibuster,” as Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar told NPR’s Throughline ahead of the 2020 election.Segregationists weren’t the only ones who wanted to preserve the Electoral College. Some Black leaders, such as Vernon Jordan, argued in the 1970s that Black voters could wield political power as “swing” election deciders. But many of those leaders later opted to support a popular vote.The college’s supporters include the conservative Heritage Foundation, which says it prevents presidential candidates from focusing only on winning votes from high-population and urban areas, thus addressing “the Founders’ fears of a ‘tyranny of the majority,” according to its website.The Heritage Foundation also says the Electoral College tends to magnify the margin of victory, imparting a mandate to govern; and “has the added benefit of eschewing radical candidates for more moderate ones.”Even experts who want change also warn that some of the impacts could be unpredictable.For instance, Akhil Reed Amar, a law professor at Yale University, told NPR’s Throughline that running a new, national direct election would bring complications — from what central federal authority oversees it to how to get 50 states to agree on the rules.But, Amar added, “Here's my best argument for why we should have reform: equality. One person, one vote. Each person's vote should count the same…. One person, one vote is a powerful affirmation of equality.”In the face of high federal hurdles such as a constitutional amendment, there is a push for change at the state level.Under the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, states adopt legislation requiring them to award their electors’ votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote nationwide. The mechanism would kick in once enough states join the compact to decide a presidential election.As of this year, National Popular Vote legislation has become law in 17 states and D.C., reflecting 209 electoral votes. In 2023, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed his state’s version of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. This year, Maine also joined the group.The legislation “has also passed at least one legislative chamber in 7 states possessing 74 electoral votes (Arkansas, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, Virginia),” according to the National Popular Vote website.The compact needs to add states holding 61 more electoral votes to trigger the change.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

he 2024 presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris comes to a head Tuesday on Election Day. The winner won’t be decided by the number of votes cast in their favor but by a group of 538 people that make up the Electoral College.“When you go vote for President, you do not vote for President,” says William Field, political science professor at Rutgers University. Instead, you are voting for that party’s electors, who typically cast a vote in favor of the presidential candidate that wins the most votes in that state.It's a process that dates back centuries and has proven controversial, particularly in instances when a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. Most recently, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite earning nearly 3 million votes less overall, marking the fifth time in U.S. history that a candidate has become President without winning the most votes. Sixty-three percent of Americans say that they would prefer it if the winner of the presidential election were decided by the popular vote, according to a Pew Research Center 2024 report, though there are partisan divides. Eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters are in favor of abolishing the Electoral College compared to 46% of Republicans. Despite the more than 700 proposals introduced in Congress to reform or get rid of the Electoral College, according to the National Archives, it remains in place today. Under the Electoral College, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are allocated a certain number of electoral votes equal to their two senators and their number of representatives. Since representatives are based on the population of a state, that means larger states, like California and Texas, have the highest number of electoral votes at 54 and 40. Five states—Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming—have the least electoral votes at three. The election is essentially decided state-by-state. If a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, typically, they receive all of the states electoral college votes—even if the race is close.But in Maine and Nebraska, there are split electoral votes, which means two electoral votes are given to the state’s popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote goes out to the popular vote winner per congressional district. In total, there are 538 electors who will cast a vote in favor of a particular presidential candidate. In order to win the presidential election, candidates must receive a majority of the possible 538 votes, or at least 270 votes. After voters cast their ballots on Election Day, races are eventually called in every state, with the first results starting to come in on Election Day. States have until Dec. 10 to finalize any disputes or finish recounts over the results. On Dec. 17, electors meet to cast their ballots for President. The copies of the ballots are then sent to the president of the U.S. Senate, or Vice President to officially be counted. On Jan. 6, Congress meets to count the electoral votes and certify victory for the candidate who has received at least 270.If no presidential candidate gets 270 votes, then Congress will elect the President and Vice President. Each state’s House representatives will cast a ballot in favor of one candidate. In this scenario, a candidate must earn at least 26 votes to win the presidency. The Senate elects the Vice President. Each Senator casts one vote for a vice presidential candidate, and whoever receives 51 votes will be elected. If the House of Representatives does not elect a president by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, then the Vice-President elect becomes the interim President until the House comes to a decision.The rules for the Electoral College are outlined in the 12th Amendment of the Constitution. Because democracy was a new idea at the time, says Field, the nation’s founders thought it would be best to have the states elect a President rather than voters directly. This decision was part of the checks and balances system prevalent throughout the American political system, but it also reflected the Founding Fathers’ lack of trust in voters, says John Sacher, a history professor at the University of Central Florida.“They wanted property owning white men to vote,” he says. “They wanted to make sure that people were virtuous who voted. They were concerned that if you allow the people too much power, that the people might choose poorly.”The logistics at the time also made it more difficult to get people to cast their ballot during a period with reduced and slower transportation, lower literacy rates, and limited opportunities for education. In fact, it was not until the election of 1824 that eligible voters, not just electors, cast a ballot for the next leader of the U.S.  Read More: The Debate That Gave Us the Electoral CollegeSlavery also played a role in the establishment of the Electoral College when delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention agreed on the so-called three-fifths compromise in determining representation in the House. “In order to distribute the number of congressional seats and therefore the electoral votes, they would count an enslaved person as three-fifths of a human being,” says Field. “They couldn't vote, but it boosted the seeming population of those states that had large numbers of lay people.” This made it so that those in the North would not wield significantly more power than those in the South, where many people remained enslaved. Electors are selected by each political party, but the guidelines vary by state. Guidelines that apply to all states include that no senator, representative, or person who holds an “office of trust or profit in the U.S.” can be an elector. State officials who have previously held an “insurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid and comfort to its enemies” are also disqualified. While electors often vote for the presidential candidate they have pledged to vote for, sometimes “faithless electors,” do not do so. In 2016, seven electors went rogue—the most since 1972, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-five states and D.C. have laws against faithless electors. Violation of these laws could lead to fines or elector disqualification depending on the state. In New Mexico and South Carolina, faithless electors could face a criminal penalty. But, these faithless actors have never changed the outcome of an election.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: We don’t know what we think we know about how Americans will vote.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Well, it’s that time again: Millions of Americans are stress-eating while clicking “Refresh” on 538’s presidential forecast, hoping beyond hope that the little red or blue line will have made a tiny tick upward. Some may be clutching themselves in the fetal position, chanting under their breath: “There’s a good new poll out of Pennsylvania.”The stakes of this election are sky-high, and its outcome is not knowable in advance—a combination that most of us find deeply discomfiting. People crave certainty, and there’s just one place to look for it: in the data. Earlier humans might have turned to oracles or soothsayers; we have Nate Silver. But the truth is that polling—and the models that rely primarily on polling to forecast the election result—cannot confidently predict what will happen on November 5.The widespread perception that polls and models are raw snapshots of public opinion is simply false. In fact, the data are significantly massaged based on possibly reasonable, but unavoidably idiosyncratic, judgments made by pollsters and forecasting sages, who interpret and adjust the numbers before presenting them to the public. They do this because random sampling has become very difficult in the digital age, for reasons I’ll get into; the numbers would not be representative without these corrections, but every one of them also introduces a margin for human error.Most citizens see only the end product: a preposterously precise statistic, such as the notion that Donald Trump has a 50.2 percent—not 50.3 percent, mind you—chance of winning the presidency. (Why stop there? Why not go to three decimal points?) Such numerical precision gives the false impression of certainty where there is none.Read: The world is falling apart. Blame the flukes.Early American political polls were unscientific but seemingly effective. In the early 20th century, The Literary Digest, a popular magazine in its day, sent sample ballots to millions of its readers. By this method, the magazine correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election from 1916 until 1936. In that year, for the contest between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Alf Landon, the Digest sent out roughly 10 million sample ballots and received an astonishing 2.4 million back (a response rate of 24 percent would be off the charts by modern standards). Based on those responses, the Digest predicted that FDR would receive a drubbing, winning just 41 percent of the vote. Instead, he won 61 percent, carrying all but two states. Readers lost faith in the Digest (it went out of business two years later).The conventional wisdom was that the poll failed because in addition to its readers, the Digest selected people from directories of automobile and telephone ownership, which skewed the sample toward the wealthy—particularly during the Great Depression, when cars and phones were luxuries. That is likely part of the explanation, but more recent analysis has pointed to a different problem: who responded to the poll and who didn’t. For whatever reason, Landon supporters were far more likely than FDR supporters to send back their sample ballots, making the poll not just useless, but wildly misleading. This high-profile error cleared the way for more “scientific” methods, such as those pioneered by George Gallup, among others.The basic logic of the new, more scientific method was straightforward: If you can generate a truly random sample from the broader population you are studying—in which every person has an equally likely chance of being included in the poll—then you can derive astonishingly accurate results from a reasonably small number of people. When those assumptions are correct and the poll is based on a truly random sample, pollsters need only about 1,000 people to produce a result with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.To produce reasonably unbiased samples, pollsters would randomly select people from the telephone book and call them. But this method became problematic when some people began making their phone numbers unlisted; these people shared certain demographic characteristics, so their absence skewed the samples. Then cellphones began to replace landlines, and more pollsters made use of “random-digit dialing,” which ensured that every active line had an equal chance of being called. For a while, that helped.But the matter of whom pollsters contacted was not the only difficulty. Another was how those people responded, and why. A distortion known as social-desirability bias is the tendency of respondents to lie to pollsters about their likely voting behavior. In America, that problem was particularly acute around race: If a campaign pitted a minority candidate against a white candidate, some white respondents might lie and say that they’d vote for the minority candidate to avoid being perceived as racist. This phenomenon, contested by some scholars, is known as the Bradley Effect, named after former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley—a Black politician who was widely tipped to become governor of California based on pre-election polling, but narrowly lost instead. To deal with the Bradley Effect, many pollsters switched from live callers to robocalls, hoping that voters would be more honest with a computer than another person.But representative sampling has continued to become more difficult. In an age of caller ID and smartphones, along with persistent junk and nuisance calls, few people answer when they see unfamiliar numbers. Most Americans spend much of their time online, but there are no reliable methods to get a truly random sample from the internet. (Consider, for example, how subscribers of The Atlantic differ from the overall American population, and it’s obvious why a digital poll on this site would be worthless at making predictions about the overall electorate.)These shifts in technology and social behavior have created an enormous problem known as nonresponse bias. Some pollsters release not just findings but total numbers of attempted contacts. Take, for example, this 2018 New York Times poll within Michigan’s Eighth Congressional District. The Times reports that it called 53,590 people in order to get 501 responses. That’s a response rate lower than 1 percent, meaning that the Times pollsters had to call roughly 107 people just to get one person to answer their questions. What are the odds that those rare few who answered the phone are an unskewed, representative sample of likely voters? Zilch. As I often ask my undergraduate students: How often do you answer when you see an unknown number? Now, how often do you think a lonely elderly person in rural America answers their landline? If there’s any systematic difference in behavior, that creates a potential polling bias.To cope, pollsters have adopted new methodologies. As the Pew Research Center notes, 61 percent of major national pollsters used different approaches in 2022 than they did in 2016. This means that when Americans talk about “the polls” being off in past years, we’re not comparing apples with apples. One new polling method is to send text messages with links to digital surveys. (Consider how often you’d click a link from an unknown number to understand just how problematic that method is.) Many pollsters rely on a mix of approaches. Some have started using online “opt-in” methods, in which respondents choose to take a survey and are typically paid a small amount for participating. This technique, too, has raised reasonable questions about accuracy: One of my colleagues at University College London, Thomas Gift, tested opt-in methods and found that nearly 82 percent of participants in his survey likely lied about themselves in order to qualify for the poll and get paid. Pew further found that online opt-in polls do a poor job of capturing the attitudes of young people and Hispanic Americans.No matter the method, a pure, random sample is now an unattainable ideal—even the aspiration is a relic of the past. To compensate, some pollsters try to design samples representative of known demographics. One common approach, stratification, is to divide the electorate into subgroups by gender, race, age, etc., and ensure that the sample includes enough of each “type” of voter. Another involves weighting some categories of respondents differently from others, to match presumptions about the broader electorate. For example, if a polling sample had 56 percent women, but the pollster believed that the eventual electorate would be 52 percent women, they might weigh male respondents slightly more heavily in the adjusted results.Read: The asterisk on Kamala Harris’s poll numbersThe problem, of course, is that nobody knows who will actually show up to vote on November 5. So these adjustments may be justified, but they are inherently subjective, introducing another possible source of human bias. If women come out to vote in historically high numbers in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, for example, the weighting could be badly off, causing a major polling error.The bottom line is that modern pollsters are trying to correct for known forms of possible bias in their samples by making subjective adjustments to the data. If their judgments are correct, then their polls might be accurate. But there’s no way to know beforehand whether their assumptions about, say, turnout by demographic group are wise or not.Forecasters then take that massaged polling data and feed it into a model that’s curated by a person—or team of people—who makes further subjective assessments. For example, the 538 model adjusts its forecasts based on polls plus what some in the field call “the fundamentals,” such as historical trends around convention polling bounces, or underlying economic data. Most forecasters also weight data based on how particular pollsters performed in earlier elections. Each adjustment is an educated guess based on past patterns. But nobody knows for sure whether past patterns are predictive of future results. Enough is extraordinary about this race to suspect that they may not be.More bad news: Modern polling often misses the mark even when trying to convey uncertainty, because pollsters grossly underestimate their margins of error. Most polls report a plus or minus margin of, say, 3 percent, with a 95 percent confidence interval. This means that if a poll reports that Trump has the support of 47 percent of the electorate, then the reported margin of error suggests that the “real” number likely lies between 44 percent (minus three) and 50 percent (plus three). If the confidence interval is correct, that spread of 44 to 50 should capture the actual result of the election about 95 percent of the time. But the reality is less reassuring.In a 2022 research paper titled “Election Polls Are 95 Percent Confident but Only 60 Percent Accurate,” Aditya Kotak and Don Moore of UC Berkeley analyzed 6,000 polls from 2008 through 2020. They found that even with just one week to go before Election Day, only about six in 10 polls captured the end result within their stated margin of error. Four in 10 times, the polling data fell outside that window. The authors conclude that to justify a 95 percent confidence interval, pollsters should “at least double” their reported margins of error—a move that would be statistically wise but render polling virtually meaningless in close elections. After all, if a margin of error doubled to six percentage points, then a poll finding that Harris had 50 percent support would indicate that the “true” number was somewhere between 44 percent (a Trump landslide) and 56 percent (a Harris landslide).Alas, the uncertainty doesn’t end there. Unlike many other forms of measurement, polls can change what they’re measuring. Sticking a thermometer outside doesn’t make the weather hotter or colder. But poll numbers can and do shift voting behavior. For example, studies have shown that perceived poll momentum can make people more likely to vote for the surging party or candidate in a “bandwagon” effect. Take the 2012 Republican primaries, when social conservatives sought an alternative to Mitt Romney and were split among candidates. A CNN poll conducted the night before the Iowa caucus showed Rick Santorum in third place. Santorum went on to win the caucus, likely because voters concluded from the poll that he was the most electable challenger.The truth is that even after election results are announced, we may not really know which forecasters were “correct.” Just as The Literary Digest accurately predicted the winner of presidential races with a deeply flawed methodology, sometimes a bad approach is just lucky, creating the illusion of accuracy. And neither polling nor electoral dynamics are stable over time. Polling methodology has shifted radically since 2008; voting patterns and demographics are ever-changing too. Heck, Barack Obama won Indiana in 2008; recent polls suggest that Harris is losing there by as much as 17 points. National turnout was 55 percent in 2016 and 63 percent in 2020. Polls are trying to hit a moving target with instruments that are themselves constantly changing. For all of these reasons, a pollster who was perfectly accurate in 2008 could be wildly off in 2024.In other words, presidential elections are rare, contingent, one-off events. Predicting their outcome does not yield enough comparable data points to support any pollster’s claim to exceptional foresight, rather than luck. Trying to evaluate whether a forecasting model is “good” just from judging its performance on the past four presidential elections is a bit like trying to figure out whether a coin is “fair” or “rigged” from just four coin flips. It’s impossible.Read: The man who’s sure that Harris will winThe social scientists Justin Grimmer, Dean Knox, and Sean Westwood recently published research supporting this conclusion. They write: “We demonstrate that scientists and voters are decades to millennia away from assessing whether probabilistic forecasting provides reliable insights into election outcomes.” (Their research has sparked fierce debate among scholars about the wisdom of using probabilistic forecasting to measure rare and idiosyncratic events such as presidential elections.)Probabilistic presidential forecasts are effectively unfalsifiable in close elections, meaning that they can’t be proved wrong. Nate Silver’s model in 2016 suggested that Hillary Clinton had a 71.4 percent chance of victory. That wasn’t necessarily “wrong” when she lost: After all, as Silver pointed out to the Harvard Gazette, events with a 28.6 percent probability routinely happen—more frequently than one in four times. So was his 2016 presidential model “wrong”? Or was it bang-on accurate, but an unusual, lower-probability event took place? There’s no way of knowing for sure.The pollsters and forecasters who are studying the 2024 election are not fools. They are skilled analysts attempting some nearly impossible wizardry by making subjective adjustments to control for possible bias while forecasting an uncertain future. Their data suggest that the race is a nail-biter—and that may well be the truth. But nobody—not you, not me, not the betting markets, not Nate Silver—knows what’s going to happen on November 5.More StoriesTrump Says Americans ‘Won’t Have to Vote Anymore’ If He WinsThe CrowdStrike Failure Was a Warning

CONTENT: By Leila Fadel, Ziad Buchh, Arezou RezvaniPro-Palestinian supporters hold a candlelight vigil in Dearborn, Mich., on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza.DEARBORN, Mich. — This city, home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the country, is a city in deep mourning over two wars in the Middle East thousands of miles away.The signs of that grief are everywhere.At a funeral for a Lebanese American man killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon.At a candlelight vigil where people bowed their heads in prayer.And on the walls of a local coffee shop and art gallery, Black Box, covered in the colors of Lebanese and Palestinian flags. Playing cards with pictures of President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are also taped up, each marked with the words “war criminal.”Lisa Alcodray speaks with a customer about the exhibition inside the Black Box cafe on Oct. 10 in Dearborn, Mich.Many residents here have loved ones who have been killed in Lebanon and Gaza. They say they feel betrayed by the Democratic Party over the administration’s continued military support for Israel despite global alarm over the level of civilians killed and suffering.They’re trying to figure out how to express this pain at the ballot box in less than a week.Back in February, a self-described anti-war coalition called the Uncommitted Movement, led by Arab and Muslim American Democrats, rallied voters to send a message to President Biden: get a cease-fire, stop sending weapons to Israel, or risk losing voters in Michigan.More than 100,000 voters heeded the call during the Democratic primary and checked “uncommitted” on the ballot.Today, Biden is no longer the Democratic candidate, and Vice President Harris is at the top of the ticket. However, for those who chose "uncommitted" — the majority of whom have voted Democratic in the past — support for Harris is by no means guaranteed in this key swing state, where she and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck.All these months later, there is no cease-fire in Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. In fact, it’s expanded to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Calls to end or condition U.S. military aid to Israel over the level of civilians killed and infrastructure destroyed have gone largely unheeded.“It’s such a tough moment. It feels like a moment of impossibility,” said Abbas Alawieh, the co-founder of the Uncommitted Movement and a Democratic organizer. “I'm feeling a certain level of despair, and I'm also feeling the contradictions of that despair being so rooted in the policy of our government to send weapons and bombs to kill people I love.”The unity that was so apparent in February among Arab Americans, young voters and other progressives in the Detroit metro area has fractured, and people are divided on how to express their objections to U.S. policy with their limited political power come Election Day.Abbas Alawieh is still choosing Harris. "I've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?" Alawieh said on Oct. 1.“When [Harris] became the candidate, we made this offer that if you change the policy, then we’ll automatically endorse you, and if you can’t change the policy then give us something,” Alawieh said, his face pale and his hands shaking as he spoke in a Dearborn cafe. “Not only did they not give us anything, they actively worked to push voters for whom this is a top issue away.”The inability to get anything from Harris has diminished the credibility of this movement in the view of so many in his own community, home to the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Their families hail from the cities and towns being bombed by Israel right now. More than 2,700 people have been killed in a matter of weeks and over a million displaced, according to the country's Health Ministry.Despite Alawieh’s pain over the deaths of his own family members in Lebanon and his displaced loved ones, he is still choosing Harris.“I'm looking at Trump's plans, and I know it could get worse,” he said. “Trump is actively accepting contributions from people who want the full annexation of the West Bank. Trump, very importantly, has very specific plans for how he will criminalize our anti-war organizing here in this country. And that is a clear difference from Vice President Harris.”It’s a choice that has isolated him. Alawieh’s movement didn’t endorse Harris but still warned against voting for a third party and of what it sees as the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency.“I've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?” he said. “I have a hard time figuring out how to respond to that.”People here don’t use the word “war” to describe what’s happening in Gaza, where more than 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, aid has been intermittently blocked by Israel, hospitals bombed and people are trapped and unable to flee. They say genocide.It’s the subject of a case before the International Court of Justice and something Israel denies. Israel says it's going after Hamas which led the deadliest attack in that country’s history that killed some 1,200 people and saw fighters take some 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.The International Criminal Court's prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas officials over alleged war crimes.Now all those voters Alawieh helped mobilize just a few months ago are “being left on the table" by his party.And across the cafe, Samraa Luqman, a Yemeni American community organizer, is ready to pick those votes up for Trump.She said she met with former President Trump recently in Dearborn, where he made a promise to her to end the war. That stands in stark contrast to his public statements, in which he said Israel should “finish the job” and criticized Harris and Biden for calling for a cease-fire. At a rally for Trump just this weekend, speakers used racist and misogynistic rhetoric, including Rudy Giuliani. He demonized Palestinian toddlers, falsely claiming they are “taught to kill us at two years old.”Samraa Luqman, an activist and community organizer, at Haraz Coffee House in Dearborn on Oct. 1.Asked why, despite this rhetoric, she believes Trump’s promise to end the war, Luqman says he’s more likely to do so than Harris.“Believe him or not, if there is a 99% chance that Trump is going to continue the genocide and I have to weigh it against 100% chance that it's going to continue under Harris, I'm going to take the 99% chance,” she said. “The fact that there is that slight hope means that I need to go with the best thing for my people.”And she’s not the only one making this calculation. This weekend, several prominent Arab and Muslim leaders endorsed Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan.Luqman’s children are half-Palestinian, and this year of watching kids being killed is intolerable, she said. She blames the Biden administration and Harris directly for these deaths.“It hurts a lot. That hurt has transformed into rage,” she said. “I will do everything in my power to ensure Harris loses. Whatever I can do. And, I’m still a Democrat.”She sees this as a path to building real political power for a community that has over 200,000 votes in Michigan. For context, Trump won this state by about 11,000 votes in 2016 and Biden won by over 150,000 in 2020.Luqman wears a necklace featuring the Palestinian flag.“If Muslims are credited with swinging an election,” she said, “imagine the political strength we're going to have. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to be vying for our vote.”But most Arab American and Muslim Americans NPR interviewed around Dearborn said that if they don’t stay home on Election Day, they’ll go with a third-party choice: Jill Stein.The Green Party candidate has been actively campaigning in Michigan promising to “end the genocide.”She has no chance of winning, but she could pull a chunk of support from Harris, and the Harris campaign is running out of time to win these voters over.In the last few weeks, her campaign has made overtures. Last month, Harris met with some American Muslims and Arab Americans over an hour away in Flint. This weekend, a different group of Arab Americans endorsed Harris in Dearborn. They called her the strategic choice despite their disappointment. Trump, they said, has shown indifference to Palestinian suffering while promising mass deportations and the revival of a travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, known as the Muslim ban.The Harris campaign told NPR she is “committed to earn every vote” and that she has been steadfast in her support for American Muslims “including ensuring that they can live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration.”Some American Muslims view this as Harris making a real effort despite having to uphold Biden’s policies.Imam Mika'il Stewart Saadiq sits inside Kitab Cafe in Detroit on Oct. 10. He is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.“I’m not voting for Kamala because I’m afraid of Trump. I see her as a great candidate,” said Imam Mika’il Stewart Saadiq, a Black Muslim leader born and raised in Detroit.He is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.“I don't think it's fair that we lay the blame of the mess of eight years of older white men at the feet of a Black woman in our generation who's saying cease-fire now before the president said it,” he said in an interview. “We've seen what Trump can do. We've seen what Biden can do. Let's see what she can do.”Saadiq voted uncommitted in the primary, but once Harris got on the ticket he got behind her.“I respect people's righteous indignation and people saying I just can't vote. I'm never going to try and convince a Palestinian American that they should understand my political calculus,” he said. “But then when it comes to Trump and the MAGA beast at the gate, again we ask the question, OK, now are you asking me to sacrifice myself? Because remember, anti-Black racism, usually when you're darker, you get it the worst.”He shares a parable from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad to make his point. The story is about a boat with lower- and upper-deck passengers.“We're all in the same boat. We are Americans,” Saadiq said. “People at the bottom of the boat, they want water, so they're like, ‘Hey, we have an idea. We're going to bust a hole in the bottom of the boat and get water.’ If the people at the upper level don't stop them, then everybody sinks. So in this hysterical political climate, there are some of us that say, OK. Don't put the hole in the bottom of the boat. Don't sink everybody.”But with just days until the election and the war expanding, many Arab and Muslim American voters in this battleground state said they already feel like they’re sinking.This story was edited for digital by Majd Al-Waheidi.

n 2024, podcasts eclipsed traditional media outlets in their influence over the U.S. election as certain shows with massive audiences managed to score interviews with sought-after subjects trying to widen their reach.Just look at Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to talk to Alexander Cooper on Call Her Daddy, a popular podcast known mostly for raunchy sex jokes that crucially attracts young women. Or President-elect Donald Trump's bro-cast tour on shows like The Joe Rogan Experience that are wildly popular among young men.Read More: Call Her Daddy’s Alexandra Cooper Made Her Name Talking About Sex. Now She’s Pushing Beyond ThatSorry, but you won't find any of those shows on this best-of list. While some are enjoyable listens, those hosts by definition are not asking our world leaders the hardest questions: That's why many powerful people prefer to do interviews on those platforms rather than with traditional news outlets.Still, you will find some of podcasting's most famous faces—voices?—on this roundup. Call me nostalgic but I found myself seeking out old favorites this fall. Shows I had not listened to for years, like 99% Invisible and Modern Love, experimented with new topics and formats that drew me back into the fold. I eagerly tuned in to new shows from beloved podcasting veterans like Reply All's Alex Goldman, Missing Richard Simmons' Dan Taberski, or Still Processing's Wesley Morris. And the Lonely Island guys did the impossible: Recording a television recap podcast that's actually funny and worth your time.Here are the best podcasts of the year.As the name might suggest, this audio diary show isn't about becoming a girl boss or perfecting the high wire act of motherhood. In each episode, a different woman in a particularly fascinating circumstance records a day in her normal life. Some of the more enthralling stories include a recording from an 80-something pinup girl about her time shopping for vibrators and a telehealth abortion provider who works for the intentionally provocative Satanic Temple.The host-less format is a risk—the episodes don't have a particular unifying theme or message about womanhood. But we are safe in the hands of two podcasting veterans who know a little something about being a lady: Jane Marie investigated multilevel marketing schemes that target women in The Dream, and Joanna Solotaroff helped produce one of the first breakout comedy podcasts, 2 Dope Queens. The resulting show celebrates women—whatever their specific experiences may be.Start Here: Finally! A Show About an 83 Year Old Calendar GirlJon Ronson's podcast on the culture wars is back for a second season that is even better than the first. Ronson, who wrote Men Who Stare at Goats and So You've Been Publicly Shamed among other works, has spent much of the last couple decades chronicling the erosion of our shared notion of truth. Things Fell Apart tries to understand how this fracture occurred by exploring the unlikely origins of major cultural shifts.Each episode asks a question: How does a serial killer targeting Black sex workers in the 1980s connect to the killing of George Floyd in 2020? How does a bestselling book on trauma fuel campus protests? The stories themselves are engrossing. They take twists and turns that you won't expect. But the overall effect is chilling.Start Here: S2. Ep1: The Most Mysterious DeathsMidlife is often marked by crises, boredom, and restlessness. Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code and all-around high-achieving woman, feels ready to blow up her monotonous existence as she stares down 50. On this show, she invites on accomplished women to offer guidance on finding happiness at a challenging time when kids are leaving the home, careers stall, and the body begins to shift.Saujani takes a few cues from fellow Lemonada podcaster Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who attempts to extract wisdom on aging from women in their 70s and beyond in Wiser Than Me. This show is aimed at a younger demographic and Saujani brings an almost pleading vulnerability to the conversations: She seems to genuinely need guidance on how to endure. Her impressive array of early guests includes Louis-Dreyfus herself, famous economist and parenting guru Emily Oster, and none other than Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. They offer an array of useful life tips: always find a new way to challenge yourself at work, schedule sex with your partner, and take a 20-minute nap when you're overwhelmed—in the Safeway parking lot, if you have to.Start Here: It Could Be F*cking Great With Julia Louis-DreyfusThe preeminent podcast on design—from architecture to clothing to the staging of this year's Olympics—deserves recognition nearly every year. This year, they decided to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Robert Moses biography, The Power Broker, with a book club of sorts. Show host Roman Mars and Daily Show writer Elliott Kalan examine Robert Caro's deep dive into the man who had a greater impact on forming New York City than arguably anybody else in history, inviting guests like New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to talk about Moses' legacy.Under Moses' supervision, the city built 35 highways, 13 bridges, parks, playgrounds, housing projects, Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium, and the 1964 World's Fair. But the urban planner also bulldozed through entire neighborhoods to build his ideal city—and doomed New Yorkers to terrible traffic by refusing to expand certain roadways beyond a few lanes. The podcast provides the perfect excuse to finally dip into the 1,200-page tome.Start Here: The Power Broker #1: Robert CaroThe Modern Love Podcast, an adaptation of the beloved New York Times column, has cycled through many formats over the years. Authors have read their essays on love, and so have celebrities. Hosts have conducted conversations with the writers and with readers. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the column, the podcast is yet again trying something new. In a series of recent episodes, host Anna Martin has asked celebrities ranging from Penn Badgley to Samin Nosrat to read essays and then spoken with them about the essays' amorous themes.The format works well. It's rare to hear guarded people open up, but something about reading heart-wrenching piece of writing preps these celebrities for honesty. Several come ready to spill—no one more so than Andrew Garfield, a heart-on-his-sleeve actor whose viral episode brought many to tears. The following episode with Chicken Shop Date host Amelia Dimoldenberg is not quite as vulnerable but equally as intriguing (especially given Garfield and Dimoldenberg's recent flirtations). You could say I've rekindled my relationship with Modern Love.Start Here: Andrew Garfield Wants to Crack Open Your HeartChenjerai Kumanyika of Uncivil is back with a show that delves into the history and mythology of the NYPD. That story, inevitably, ties to the evolution of policing in America as a whole. The podcast begins with a disturbing video shot by the NYPD surveilling Kumanyika's father, a civil right activist. Rewatching the footage inspired Kumanyika to take on this project.Kumanyika demonstrates how the very foundation of the institution is built on uneven ground: During the Civil War, New York police officers earned payments by kidnapping free Black men and women in the city and shipping them South to be enslaved. He then follows the evolution of the NYPD and the many problematic structural decisions that eroded trust between the police and the people they are sworn to protect. Throughout eight episodes, Kumanyika interweaves personal narrative with rigorous research on the NYPD's history to make the compelling argument that New Yorkers' safety isn't actually the prime objective of the nation's largest police force.Start Here: They Keep People Safe | 1Reply All was one of the longest-running and most beloved podcasts in the tech space until it imploded in 2022. Since, the two former co-hosts have struck out on their own and, after some experimentation, landed on podcast concepts that are, frankly, extremely similar to Reply All. That's not a criticism—many people dearly miss the original show.PJ Vogt's excellent Search Engine, which answers a wide range of questions about everything from animals in zoos to fentanyl in drugs, has only gotten better since it made my Top 10 list last year. Now comes Alex Goldman's Hyperfixed, a help desk podcast that riffs on Reply All's "Super Tech Support" segment. Goldman bills himself as an“overconfident idiot” all too eager to help with random problems that unfold in unexpected ways. An episode on a New Yorker who needs Goldman's help getting her driver's license expands into an investigation into why driving in New York is awful. An entry on perfecting a baking recipe diverts into the confounding history of the U.S. refusing to implement the metric system and an interview with award-winning chef Nancy Silverton. Though Goldman has only produced two episodes so far, the series proved immediately addictive and charming. I'm betting I'll become a regular listener.Start Here: Eva Needs to MeasureAs a dedicated listener to both Do You Like Prince Movies? from Grantland and Still Processing from the New York Times, I would tune in to just about anything Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Wesley Morris creates. Morris formerly co-hosted those shows with other writers. The Wonder of Stevie is a different endeavor, an overview and deep analysis of the career of an iconic musician that Morris tackles solo, though he occasionally gets a helping hand from none other than former President Barack Obama. Morris interviews the likes of Questlove, Janelle Monae and Michelle Obama about Stevie Wonder's career. (The Obamas' Higher Ground helped produce the podcast.)The podcast begins in 1972. Over the next five years, Wonder produced five albums and won half a dozen Grammys, one of the most impressive runs in music history. Even if you don’t care about Wonder, you should care about what Morris cares about: He is always able to succinctly divine meaning from great art. And this podcast in particular is a joyful celebration. He also heroically moderates a conversation in the final episode between Barack Obama and Stevie Wonder himself.Start Here: Music of My Mind | 1972Typically, podcasts that involve celebrities recapping their own shows tend to be self-indulgent, un-analytical, and not particularly revealing. But I fell hard for The Lonely Island & Seth Meyers Podcast. Each episodes focuses on a different Lonely Island Saturday Night Live sketch. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer offer insight into the stressful yet hilarious process of writing joke songs about d—cks in boxes with Justin Timberlake and coming up with swear words for Natalie Portman to rap.It's a cliche to praise podcasts for effortless chemistry, but it should be no surprise that a trio that has worked together for decades on songs like "I'm on a Boat" and movies like Pop Star have it. (So does Meyers, who apparently is in a daily text exchange with Samberg about their Spelling Bee scores.) The podcast serves up unabashedly nostalgic content for those of us who came of age in the late 2000s, but it also lands at an existential moment for SNL on the eve of its 50th anniversary. Some 20 years ago, Lonely Island dragged SNL into the YouTube era and set trends that persist on TikTok today. Perhaps there are lessons to be gleaned from this throwback show for the future of comedy.Start Here: Lazy SundayThe most engrossing podcast Dan Taberski has produced since Missing Richard Simmons, Hysterical investigates a mysterious illness that spread among high school girls randomly exhibiting Tourette's-like symptoms about a decade ago in Le Roy, New York. The incident is believed to be the largest case of mass hysteria since the Salem Witch Trials. The show explores the origins of hysteria, other modern examples, and what patients do when confronted with the frustrating diagnosis that their symptoms are "all in their head."While the history of hysteria is intriguing, Hysterical is at its strongest when Taberski is speaking with the women who were once afflicted by what they argue was a mysterious—but very real—illness. The scandal occurred near Taberski's hometown in upstate New York, and he’s able to bring a local charm to his color commentary and interviews. He manages to make what might feel like a dour show on a serious topic feel light and brisk.Start Here: Outbreak | 1WRITE TO ELIANA DOCKTERMAN AT ELIANA.DOCKTERMAN@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Donald Trump has lost all discipline. Will that affect the outcome of the election?Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsOne thing tomorrow’s election will test is Americans’ appetite for chaos, particularly the kind that Donald Trump has been exhibiting in the last few months of his campaign. After weeks of running a disciplined campaign, Trump’s advisers lost control of their candidate, the Atlantic staff writer Tim Alberta reported this week. Trump grew restless and bored and drifted off script in his campaign appearances. During a summer interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, for example, he mused aloud about Kamala Harris, “I don’t know. Is she Indian or is she Black?” From the perspective of his advisers, Trump’s string of offensive public statements needlessly alienated potential voters. Members of Trump’s campaign staff told Alberta that they became disillusioned about their ability to rein in their candidate and left the campaign.Will this unleashed version of Trump affect the election outcome? In this week’s episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Alberta and another Atlantic staff writer, Mark Leibovich, about how candidate Trump transformed over the summer, how Kamala Harris’s campaign reacted, where each campaign stands now, and what it means for the election. Alberta and Leibovich also offer tips on how to manage your inner chaos while watching the election results.The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is a bonus episode of Radio Atlantic. We are recording the Monday before Election Day. The candidates are furiously campaigning in the swing states. At some point, their planes were on the same tarmac in North Carolina.Over the weekend, Donald Trump mused about shooting reporters; Kamala Harris said normal campaign things. And yet the race is still one of the closest in American history.Anyway, in this episode, I want to get the inside view of both political campaigns in their last days. So I have with me today two seasoned political reporters, Mark Leibovich. Hi, Mark.Mark Leibovich: Hi, Hanna.Rosin: And Tim Alberta. Hi, Tim.Tim Alberta: Hi, Hanna. Hi, Mark.Leibovich: Hi, Tim. Isn’t it good to be seasoned today?Alberta: I’m feeling very seasoned.Rosin: Yeah, that’s a cliché word. It doesn’t mean old. What’s a more flattering word than seasoned? Like, experienced? Or longtime? Longtime: that’s flattering, I think.Leibovich: It’s definitely flattering.Alberta: We don’t use veteran.Rosin: No, veteran is old. How about active?Leibovich: Yeah, we’re very active. Yeah. Can you tell by our voices?Rosin: (Laughs.) Anyway, Mark, I understand you’re writing up a preelection guide to how to approach Tuesday night.Leibovich: Basically, I’m trying to collect a helpful toolkit to how to approach Election Day from sort of a practical standpoint as far as what information you can ignore, but also a habit or even mindfulness standpoint about how to not drive yourself needlessly crazy, how not to be triggered by the kinds of things that Election Night coverage will probably overload you with.And that includes Donald Trump probably declaring victory wildly prematurely or erroneously, which, I mean, will be news because he’s one of the candidates, but it also should surprise no one. And there are ways to kind of condition yourself, or try to, going into what tomorrow night will be like—which will be obviously very anxious for a lot of people.Rosin: I see. So instead of “We know it’s going to be like that,” like, “We know that we don’t have enough information.”We know that there probably isn’t going to be, sort of, instant early clarity. So you’re going into it eyes wide open, doing what? Like, what? Because maybe Tim needs this advice.Leibovich: Well, I’m trying. Well, I think we all need this advice, Hanna. I mean, I think it’s an approach to how we consume information, how we get information.I talked to a couple of Democratic consultants who said that one of the first things they do is turn off all their text notifications, because any kind of text notification is designed to trigger you on Election Night.There is a lot of manipulation of your emotions before the actual only information that is necessary, which, the most valuable information is going to come in probably after 11 o’clock, or quite late. It could be days later. The idea is the news will find you. Turn off your phone if you can. Information is coming in haphazardly from a million different directions, out of order, in no particular sequence whatsoever, about something that has already happened—meaning the voting has already happened. So no control is there. This is basically just people throwing information out in no order, and it is not necessarily—Rosin: It’s not cumulative and it’s not adding up to—Leibovich: —Not cumulative.Rosin: Exactly. Exactly.Leibovich: So anyway, that’s one reason you can skip that part.Rosin: Interesting. Tim, do you think you could do that?Alberta: I fear that in the attempt to not drive myself crazy, I would drive myself crazy. In other words, you would find your brain stacking up with all of the things that other people know that you don’t, because in that moment you have decided to sequester yourself or at least to sort of rigidly compartmentalize your emotions and your brain waves and your political intake.And therefore the exit polling showing the number of non-college whites in Maricopa County breaking away from Trump is lost on you in that pivotal moment, when that could be the little parcel of information that is necessary for you to believe that you have finally figured out this electoral equation and that you have a bead on it in this moment.It’s a game of inches, and the inches are everywhere around us, Hanna. So how could I give up any of those inches when we are so close to the end of the game? I want the zen that Mark is offering, but I just don’t find it realistic.Rosin: Hmm. You know how sometimes you start with the moment of meditation? We’ll consider that our moment of meditation, and now we’re gonna go into the stressful part of this conversation. So, Tim, you’ve been covering the Republican side closely, and you recently spent a lot of time talking to Trump’s advisers.How would you describe the state of the campaign in the weeks before the election?Alberta: I would describe it as something slightly removed from the serenity that Mark has described for us.Rosin: Yes. Okay. Yeah.Alberta: Yeah, look, Hanna, I think the context here is really important: that this Trump campaign, unlike the previous two, was for the majority of its time in operation, really pretty disciplined, pretty smart.The people running the campaign had done a pretty good job of keeping Trump out of his own way and talking him out of bad ideas and sort of curbing some of his most self-destructive impulses. And what we’ve seen in the last couple of months is basically Trump going full Trump, and an inability among those senior advisers to really do anything to stop it.This has been kind of the proverbial slow-motion car wreck. And, you know, it’s not just Trump himself, although of course he is the inspiration for the chaos. He is the generator of all of the turmoil that you see.He is at the center of this chaos, but the chaos ripples out away from him. And so when you ask yourself the question of how could it be that at the most important public event of the campaign, with 20,000-plus jammed into Madison Square Garden in prime time, the whole world watching, and you pay a million dollars to put on this event, and the guy who kicks it off is a vulgar, shock jock, insult-roast comedian who was dropped by his own talent agency for using racial slurs onstage—how could this person possibly be booked into that position to open for Trump in that environment? It’s exactly the sort of thing that the people around him had been really successful in avoiding for most of the campaign. But ultimately, in the key home stretch here, in the sort of the witching hours of this campaign, it’s all fallen apart.Rosin: Mark, same for the Democrats. How would you describe where they are?Leibovich: I would say I’ve talked to a fair number of Democrats on the campaign in the last few days.It feels like something approaching the general area of the ballpark of confidence.Rosin: Interesting! Anomalous for Democrats.Leibovich: Well, they are so incredibly quick to embrace bad news and to go right from bad news to deep levels of doomsaying. I’ve not seen that in the last few days.I mean, look, I think their numbers internally seem a little better. I think a lot of the external polls have been encouraging. And I think you can’t underestimate how much of a train wreck Trump’s last 10 days have been, in a way that, if he loses, I think people will very much point to.Rosin: So, Mark, I remember we sat here in the spring and discussed how absolutely stagnant this race would be. Like, we were just sleepwalking into a repeat.Leibovich: But it was a great podcast. Everyone should listen to it again. (Laughs.)Rosin: But it was very, you know—we didn’t have much to say. And then for everybody, the reset button got pressed in July.Tim, the full Trump who we’ve seen on the campaign trail for the last few months started, actually, according to your account, before Harris entered the race. So what happened?Alberta: I think that maybe the proper visual here, Hanna, is like the wild animal that has chased down its prey and has mauled it mostly to death and is now just sort of pawing at it, toying with it, unsure of really what to do because, well, what’s left to do?Donald Trump really found himself, according to all the reporting I did, sort of over it. Sort of bored with running against Joe Biden. Because here is, in his view, this sort of hapless old man who can’t even string together sentences, much less really defend himself or go on offense in a meaningful way against Trump. And so I think that he’s looking at Joe Biden thinking, Gosh this is sort of a bore, and around this time, of course, in late June, early July, Trump’s polling is better than it’s ever been in any of his three campaigns for the presidency.The battleground polling is showing him consistently pulling ahead five, six, seven points across all of these states. The national polling is up. His favorability is up. Democrats are preparing for a bloodbath not just to lose the presidency but to lose the House and the Senate, and it’s, you know, The sky is falling. And everyone around Trump is sort of giddy and gleeful. They’re looking around like, Nothing can stop us.And around this time is when you started to see Trump talking a little bit differently, behaving a little bit differently, according to people close to him—almost looking for some disorder and some mayhem to inject into the campaign. He starts talking to people on the outside. And when Kamala Harris gets in the race, he was angry, on the one hand, because he thought he had it sort of sewn up against Biden, and he liked running against Biden in the sense that Biden really, you know, couldn’t punch back.But I think also he’s sort of excited in the sense that with Harris, he’s got this live target. He’s able to channel some of the base instincts that brought him to power in the first place. You know, Trump, I think, viewed the Harris switcheroo as a new lease on life in the sense that he was going to be able to go whole hog again.But the people around him were saying, No, no, no, no. That’s exactly what we don’t want you to do. And frankly, the reason you’re in this position is because you’ve listened to us and because you haven’t been going rogue and running the kind of, you know, totally undisciplined #YOLO 2016 campaign that you would like to run and that you would run if you were left to your own devices. And around that time is when Trump started to lose confidence in those people who were giving him that advice, and he brought in other people to help with the campaign, and from there things really started to spiral.Rosin: So, Mark, how are Democrats responding as Trump is reasserting this peak-Trump version of himself?Leibovich: I think in a kind of measured way. I mean, I think, look, the peak Trump pretty much speaks for itself. It’s not like you need people to amplify. I mean, to some degree you do, because outlets that a lot of Republicans watch—like, say, Fox—are going to be insulated from a lot of this, because just Fox doesn’t show it.I mean, that’s just not their point of emphasis, But I think they’ve been very deft—they’ve made a lot of ads around the kind of changing abortion messaging. I mean, even Melania Trump saying that she believes in a woman’s right to choose, things like that, to some degree, they’re trying to highlight it, but to another degree—this is a big political-operative cliché, but they are running their race.And I think the Democrats, beginning when Biden stepped aside, I think Harris has performed much better than a lot of people thought she would, and I think her campaign has made a lot of good decisions, and she herself has made a lot of good decisions.Rosin: It does, from the outside, seem exactly the opposite of the chaos inside the Trump campaign that Tim described, because if you think back to when Biden dropped out, there was some worry that the transition might not be smooth.Leibovich: Oh, 100 percent. I mean, Tim and I, remember, we were at the Republican convention together, and that was such a moment, because Trump was really kind of at his peak then, which is kind of ironic to say, because the assassination attempt had taken place two days before the convention started. But his popularity, I mean—there was a sense of confidence at that convention which was just off the charts to a degree to which you could almost sense the boredom creeping into Trump when he’s giving this acceptance speech, and I guess it was Thursday night, and then about halfway through, he just kind of went off the rails, and he just sort of—it became just a very unhinged acceptance speech, went from kind of a gripping one where he’s describing the assassination attempt to something completely different, which kind of became a metaphor for how the rest of the campaign would unfurl for him.And of course, three days later, Biden got out and then the world changed again.Rosin: All right, up next, I ask Tim and Mark whether the chaotic final months of the Trump campaign could end up costing him the election. That’s after the break.[Break]Rosin: So from a campaign manager’s perspective, the chaos is disturbing, but what we actually care about is whether it has any impact on voting day. Tim, so what are the ways the drama you describe could affect the election? Like, say, turnout or whatever it is that we’re worried about?Alberta: Well, look, if these episodes were contained to just Trump being a little bit goofy or going off message and sort of ranting and raving about the latest person who said something very nasty about him on cable news, I don’t think it would have much real-world effect. But I think that some of what we’re unpacking here over these past 10, 11, 12 weeks, Hanna, is something that actually gets to a fundamental weakness, which is a failure of the Trump team to expand its coalition.Or at the very least what we’re seeing is the way in which the potential of expanding the Trump coalition has been undermined by Trump’s own actions or by the people close to him. So, for example, we know based on six months of really solid, consistent data that Trump is likely to perform better with Latino voters as a whole and particularly with Latino men under 40 than any Republican nominee in modern history.And yet, when the dominant headline coming out of your rally at Madison Square Garden the week before the election is that one of your speakers calls the island of Puerto Rico floating trash in the ocean, this is self-sabotage.Another core component of this Trump campaign, from the beginning, has been How do we keep our margins tight in the suburbs outside of Detroit and Milwaukee and Philly and Vegas and elsewhere? How do we keep our margins tight with these college-educated, suburban women? We’re not going to win them, right? But how do we manage to keep it close? How do we lose them by just seven or eight points instead of by 16, 17, 18, 20 points?And when you look at, for example, the selection of J. D. Vance and, you know, his old, greatest-hits reel around childless cat ladies, and he thinks abortion should be illegal nationwide, right?And there’s just something that sort of went fundamentally awry over the summer. I think Mark is right. Both of us were remarking at the convention about how it was effectively an early Election Night victory party. I mean, they weren’t even—Republicans in Milwaukee weren’t even talking about the campaign as if it were going to be competitive. It was already over. The fat lady was singing onstage in prime time in Milwaukee. And yet, I remember corresponding with several smart Republicans—Trump supporters—while I was there, and they were a little bit nervous about the Vance selection. And then on Thursday night, to Mark’s point, Trump gives this sort of weird, meandering speech that seems to squander a lot of the goodwill that he had coming into that event because of the assassination attempt. And it felt like between those two things—the Vance selection and then the speech—and then, you know, 24 hours after leaving Milwaukee, Biden gets out, Harris takes over the ticket, and suddenly, those dominoes started to fall.And what we saw was all of the best-laid plans of the Trump operation go awry. And it wasn’t just surface-level things where we say, Oh, that was sort of silly he said that. Or Oh, this was an unforced error, but it’ll be a quick news cycle and blow over. Some of what we’ve seen, I think, will have a real impact at the ballot box.Rosin: So what you’re describing is a campaign strategy that is fairly traditional that they were following fairly successfully, which is: try and win over, you know, some middle-of-the-road voters, or at least not massively alienate those people.But, Trump has been running a very different kind of campaign—like going to Madison Square Garden—and fewer on-the-ground resources. And that seems like a pattern across swing states, which for me raises the question whether what these managers are calling chaos, like, that is the strategy.The strategy was always just: get a lot of attention.Alberta: I think it depends on the type of attention you’re talking about. So when Trump goes to the southern border and has, you know, hundreds of cameras following him around there and talks about the lives lost at the hands of illegal immigrants committing crimes—you know, that is attention, and it can even be attention that is rooted in some hyperbole, some demagoguing, some bombast. And yet it is productive attention politically for the Trump people, right? They look at this sort of cost-benefit analysis and they recognize that, sure, we might antagonize some people with this rhetoric. We might alienate some people with our focus on these issues, but we think that the reward is far greater than the risk.So there is, I think, plenty of good attention that the Trump people do want. I think what they’ve tried to avoid is a lot of the sideshow that is appealing to some of the very online, right-wing, MAGA troll base but does nothing to add to the coalition that I was describing a minute ago. And ultimately at the end of the day, politics is a math equation. It’s multiplication and addition.Leibovich: Right, and I think, to Tim’s point, immigration was an incredibly effective issue for Trump. When you tip that into people eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, and just how that took over the narrative of the Trump campaign—I mean, one, they look like fools; two, it insults the intelligence of so many people, and it turns a very serious and effective issue for the Trump campaign, immigration, into a joke and into just something really, really problematic and gross.Rosin: So the art of running a Trump campaign, then, is to siphon and manage and titrate the chaos exactly right. Like, you want the right kind of chaos, the right kind of attention, but if you lose control of it, it just comes back to bite you. Is that basically what’s happened?Alberta: Yeah, and it’s always gonna be a high-wire act, right? These people aren’t stupid. They knew what they were getting themselves into. In fact, Chris LaCivita—who is one of the two people managing the Trump presidential campaign here in 2024—within a few weeks of his decision to join the operation back in the fall of 2022, you have Trump saying that he wants to terminate parts of the Constitution. You have Trump saying and doing these sort of crazy, self-destructive things. And LaCivita is sort of looking around saying, What have I gotten myself into?And of course people who are friends with him are saying, Come on, dude, you knew exactly what you were signing up for. You know exactly what you were getting yourself into. So I think whatever degree of self-delusion may exist at the outset, when some of these folks ally themselves with Donald Trump, you know, it dissolves pretty quickly and they become clear-eyed about who they’re working for and what the challenges are.And to your point, Hanna, yes, there’s inevitably going to be some chaos, some attention-seeking behavior, some stuff that is vulgar and inappropriate and racist and misogynistic and whatever else. Their job is to try to turn things that are kind of potentially toxic into productivity. They’re trying to mine coals out of manure here, and again, I can’t stress this enough: For most of the campaign, they were actually doing a pretty good job of it. But at a certain point I think it just becomes too much to manage.Rosin: Mark, do you get the sense that the Harris campaign’s—you described it as, like, a little dose of confidence. Is that because of everything that Tim has described?Leibovich: Yeah. I mean, I think Trump has given them so much to work with. And not just like, Oh, look, he said this and sort of putting that out there. I mean, early indications about the revulsion that women are having—women voters are having for Trump—even more so than usual. And the degree to which they seem to be voting and maybe even lying to their husbands about—to kind of use a new ad that the Harris campaign is using which is basically saying, you know, a lot of Republican women are secretly going into the ballot, and behind their husband’s back, they’re voting for Kamala Harris. So again, Trump made their job easier, but I think they have taken what has been given to them. And I do feel hopeful. Yeah. Again, from talking to a bunch of them, and levels of very, very cautious optimism—which I would say, you know, it would probably be an absolute verboten thing for anyone anywhere near the Harris campaign to show anything more than just a tiny bit of confidence. Because that’s going to harken back to the overconfidence of 2016 or the overconfidence of 2020, you know—Biden was supposed to win by a lot more than he did.And I think what freaks everyone out is the idea that Trump, in the two times he’s been on a general-election ballot, has massively overperformed his polls. And now there’s a sense that perhaps that’s been accounted for in these polls and they’re undercounting African American voters, women voters, and so forth.So anyway, I think all of that is kind of baked into this, but look, I don’t want to suggest that anything other than massive anxiety is the default for everyone around this campaign. And I assume both campaigns.Rosin: Yeah. Okay. Let’s leave the listeners with thoughts about Election Night. There’s the zen option, and hopefully many of our listeners will take advantage of the zen option.Take a long, 12-hour walk. Be home by 11 p.m. and then turn on the television. Short of that, the map is really wide and open. I mean, seven open states. It’s a lot. So for those who are not spiritually built for the zen option, how—literally—will you guys be watching? Like, give a listener a guide of what to watch out for on the night.Leibovich: Well, yes, there are seven battleground states. But I think there’s a lot you can learn if you can get information from other states. You know, there’s a poll that everyone has been talking about—a lot of insiders have been talking about over the last few days—from Iowa. Iowa, no one considered a swing state. Safely red, certainly has been in the last few elections, certainly for Trump. Ann Selzer, a deeply respected pollster, came up with this Des Moines Register poll on Saturday night, having Harris ahead by three.Now, putting aside whether Iowa’s now a battleground state—I mean, if it’s even in the ballpark of accurate, I mean, as a euphoric result for people on Team Harris. I mean, look, if there are some early numbers from, say, South Carolina, Florida, that, you know, maybe show Trump’s margins a little lower than you would expect, possibly that’s something that you can learn from.So again, it’s not just the seven battlegrounds, which will probably take a while to count, especially in some of the states with laws that make it harder to count early votes. But, yeah, I mean, like, the whole country does vote. It’s like, margins do matter, and I think we can learn from a lot of people.And look, even, like, Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky—I mean there are these early states that you know exactly who is going to win, but you can learn from.Rosin: Because if the margins are smaller than they are expected to be, then that’s a bit of data that’s interesting. Tim, what about you?Alberta: So there’s a known known, and a known unknown. The known known is that Democrats are continuing to see erosion in their coalition, specific to African American men, Latino men, and to some degree young voters.And I think specifically if we’re looking at Detroit, at Milwaukee, at Philly, at Atlanta, at Maricopa County—there are places where we should be paying attention to this, right? I think the known unknown here is: Does Donald Trump get beaten up among suburban women, or does he get demolished among suburban women?And I think that the answer to that question is probably determinative to who is sworn into office on January 20.So I’m really paying very close attention to the collar counties outside of Philadelphia, to the WOW counties outside of Milwaukee. You have to look at Vegas and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. Some of these places—I don’t want to be reductive, but I really do feel like, ultimately, that’s where the election is going to be won or lost.Rosin: Both of you are saying: Look for signs. It’s not just big, broad swing states, but there are meaningful signs in smaller election results that you’ll be looking for.Alberta: That’s right. It’s, again, it’s just a numbers game. And it so happens that the most dense, vote-rich areas of persuadable voters are just consistently found in these once re,d then purple, now pretty blue suburbs. And so whether you’re watching the presidential race or even if you’re looking for a potential upset in a Senate race, like in Texas, where Ted Cruz on paper looks like he’s going to win and maybe even win comfortably. But pay attention to Harris County, Texas, which, on Election Night in 2012, Obama and Romney fought Harris County to basically a draw. I think it was a matter of a few hundred votes that separated them. Fast-forward, you know, a decade. Democrats are carrying Harris County, which is the Houston suburbs—they’re carrying it by a quarter-million votes, 300,000 votes reliably, and that number’s only going up.So those are the parts of the country where I think if you’re paying close attention, you’ll start to get a pretty good idea.Rosin: Okay. I think we have options for the meditators and options for those who cannot bring themselves to meditate. Thank you both for joining me on this day before the election.Leibovich: Thank you, Hanna. Thank you, Tim.Alberta: Mark, I’ll call you tomorrow. We can meditate together.Leibovich: I look forward to it. Yep, we’ll join figurative hands.Rosin: This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid. It was engineered by Rob Smierciak. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor.I’m Hanna Rosin, and we’ll be back later this week to cover the election, though possibly earlier than our usual Thursday release, depending on the results.Thanks for listening.More StoriesWhat Pete Hegseth’s Nomination Is Really AboutDemocrats’ Immigration Problem

CONTENT: P
resident-elect Donald Trump has already begun building out a team to serve in his second term. Trump’s new administration is expected to look different from his first—he said in an October interview that the “biggest mistake” of his first term was choosing “bad, disloyal people” to join his administration. Donald Trump Jr. said in mid-November, after several unconventional choices had already been made, that pushback from the Washington establishment simply reflects his father fulfilling a campaign promise to appoint “actual disruptors—that’s what the American people want.” Many of the roles will need to be confirmed by the Senate—though Trump has demanded that Republican leadership let him bypass the typical confirmation process.Here are the key appointments, nominations, and staffing decisions announced by Trump’s transition team, in a list that will continue to be updated.Trump has tapped Brooke Rollins, the cofounder and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, to head the Department of Agriculture. The Wall Street Journal reported that her nomination was unexpected, given other candidates had relatively deeper agricultural background, though Rollins has a degree in agricultural development. Rollins served during Trump’s first term as director of the Office of American Innovation and acting director of the Domestic Policy Council. “From her upbringing in the small and Agriculture-centered town of Glen Rose, Texas, to her years of leadership involvement with Future Farmers of America and 4H, to her generational Family Farming background, to guiding her four kids in their show cattle careers, Brooke has a practitioner’s experience, along with deep Policy credentials in both Nonprofit and Government leadership at the State and National levels,” Trump said in a statement announcing his pick.Trump has nominated former NFL player Scott Turner to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and address the country’s housing affordability crisis. Currently, Turner serves as chair of Center for Education Opportunity at the America First Policy Institute. During Trump’s first term, Turner served as executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, overseeing federal opportunity zones, which attempt to spur economic growth and job creation in low-income communities while providing tax benefits to investors. His work there “help[ed] to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities,” Trump said in a statement announcing Turner’s nomination.Trump has selected Dr. Marty Makary, a surgical oncologist at Johns Hopkins University, to serve as commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If confirmed by the Senate, he will work closely with Trump’s Health Secretary-designate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose nomination Makary recently voiced support for.In his statement on Makary’s nomination, Trump vowed that Kennedy Jr. and Makary would “properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning our Nation's food supply and drugs and biologics being given to our Nation's youth, so that we can finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary became an outspoken voice against vaccine mandates, calling them a “complete dismissal of natural immunity.”Trump has chosen physician, veteran, and former congressman Dave Weldon (R-Fla.) to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In his announcement of his pick, Trump emphasized Weldon’s work to ban patents on human embryos (used in stem cell research) in Congress, and wrote that Weldon has “American Family Values” and will prioritize “Transparency, Competence and High Standards” at the CDC. While in Congress, in 2007 Weldon introduced a bill that would move responsibility for vaccine safety research from the CDC to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. (CDC director will now require Senate confirmation after new legislation.)Read More: Who Decides Who Leads U.S. Health Agencies?Trump is bringing back Alex Wong, a former deputy special representative for North Korea and deputy assistant secretary for North Korea in the State Department’s bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs during Trump’s first term, to be part of his senior national security staff in his second term. In his announcement, Trump said that Wong helped negotiate his summit with North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and that Wong led the State Department’s implementation of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy.Read More: How Asia Is Bracing for Trump’s Second TermAnother White House alum returning for Trump’s second term is conservative media commentator Sebastian Gorka, whom the President-elect picked to be a deputy assistant and the senior director for counterterrorism. Born to Hungarian parents in the U.K., Gorka is a “tireless advocate for the America First Agenda and the MAGA Movement,” Trump said in his statement announcing Gorka’s position.Gorka served as a strategist in Trump’s first term, leaving the post in August 2017 following the arrival of then chief of staff John Kelly and the ouster of Steve Bannon, whom Gorka was closely aligned with. Gorka is known for his incendiary remarks against Islam and its followers, and he is reportedly “widely disdained” within his field, even among fellow conservatives. The Washington Post reported that Michael Anton, a former communications and national security official in Trump’s first administration, removed himself from contention for a deputy national security adviser role in the second term after learning he would have to work with Gorka.John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic, called Gorka a “con man” in an interview on CNN.Trump nominated physician and Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat to be the next Surgeon General, a key health information leader for the public and public health officers. Currently, Nesheiwat serves as one of the medical directors of CityMD, a network of urgent care centers in New York and New Jersey. Her sister, Julia Nesheiwat, served as homeland security advisor during Trump’s first term, and Julia’s husband, Mike Waltz, is a Republican congressman from Florida who has been tapped to serve as Trump’s national security advisor.“Dr. Nesheiwat is a fierce advocate and strong communicator for preventive medicine and public health,” Trump said in a statement. “She is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare, and believes in empowering individuals to take charge of their health to live longer, healthier lives.”Trump has tapped outgoing congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) to run the Labor Department. Chavez-DeRemer narrowly lost her re-election bid earlier this month. During her time in Congress she was one of only a few House Republicans to support the PRO Act, a major pro-union bill, and she also served on the Education and the Workforce Committee.Chavez-DeRemer has support from key labor unions and figures including Teamsters president and Trump supporter Sean O’Brien. The AFL-CIO, however, gave her a lifetime score of 10%, with regards to her support for pro-union legislation. Multiple business groups have signaled their opposition to Trump’s choice of DeRemer.“Lori’s strong support from both the Business and Labor communities will ensure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success - Making America Richer, Wealthier, Stronger and more Prosperous than ever before,” Trump said in a statement announcing DeRemer’s nomination.Trump announced that he will nominate Russell Vought, a contributor to the conservative presidential transition playbook Project 2025 that Trump distanced himself from during his campaign, to once again be the director of the Office of Management and Budget. “He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term,” Trump said in a statement, adding, “Russ knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government, and he will help us return Self Governance to the People. We will restore fiscal sanity to our Nation, and unleash the American People to new levels of Prosperity and Ingenuity.”\Trump has appointed hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to run the Treasury Department in his second-term administration. Bessent is the founder and CEO of hedge fund firm Key Square Group and previously supported Democrats before turning to support Republican candidates and eventually Trump, though he was not in Trump’s orbit during his first term. Bessent is known to support tariffs and has also backed extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He would also be the country’s first openly gay Treasury Secretary.“As a lifelong Champion of Main Street America and American Industry, Scott will support my Policies that will drive U.S. Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances, work to create an Economy that places Growth at the forefront, especially through our coming World Energy Dominance,” Trump wrote in a statement announcing Bessent’s nomination.Read More: Why CEOs Are Cheering Donald Trump’s Pick for Treasury SecretaryTrump has tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to run the Department of Justice, replacing his earlier nominee, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who withdrew from consideration after facing scrutiny over alleged sexual misconduct involving at least one minor.Bondi, a longtime Trump loyalist, served on the executive committee of his 2016 transition team, and during Trump’s first term, she was a member of Trump’s first-impeachment defense team. Since 2021, she has led the legal arm of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank formed to promote Trump’s agenda and plan for his second term.“For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,” Trump said in a statement announcing Bondi’s nomination. “Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again. I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!”Trump had previously nominated Gaetz for the role of U.S. Attorney General, prompting Gaetz to resign from Congress ahead of the release of an ethics probe that was then put on hold. (It’s not yet clear whether the committee’s report will be made public. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.) But the allegations followed Gaetz, who is deeply unpopular among many members of his own party, and in a post on X, he announced: “It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”In a post on Truth Social after Gaetz announced his withdrawal, Trump said he “greatly appreciate[s]” Gaetz’s efforts to get Senate approval but “has much respect” for his decision to step aside.Trump has nominated former congressman Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) to become the U.S. ambassador to Canada. Hoekstra served during Trump’s first term as the ambassador to the Netherlands and was a prominent campaign supporter as chair of the Michigan Republican Party. “In my Second Term, Pete will help me once again put AMERICA FIRST,” Trump said in a statement announcing his pick.Trump has named former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker to become the country’s ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In his statement announcing his pick, Trump said Whitaker is “a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended. Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.” Trump has shown dubious commitment to the military alliance, criticizing other members for not contributing as much as the U.S.Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa who was Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff until Trump fired Sessions and elevated Whitaker, has not previously served in a role focused on foreign policy. He is, however, a close ally of the President-elect, having vocally criticized special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and having come to Trump’s defense during his first impeachment proceedings, claiming: “Abuse of power is not a crime.”Trump has tapped his first-term Small Business Administration (SBA) administrator Linda McMahon to run the Department of Education during his second term. In a statement announcing his selection, Trump cited McMahon’s leadership credentials as a co-chair of his transition team alongside Commerce Secretary-designate Howard Lutnick and a chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute. McMahon, the former CEO and co-founder of WWE and a major Republican donor, has also served on the Connecticut Board of Education and on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, a state where she twice unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate.Trump promised during his campaign to dismantle the Department of Education. “We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES,” he said in his statement announcing McMahon’s nomination, “and Linda will spearhead that effort.”Trump has chosen celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department that provides health coverage to millions of Americans. In a statement announcing the pick, Trump said that Oz (known on TV as “Dr. Oz”) would work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist who has been nominated to run HHS, to “take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”“Our broken Healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country’s budget,” Trump said, adding that “Dr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention.” Oz would need to be confirmed by the Senate.As CMS Administrator, Oz would oversee programs including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance Marketplaces. During his unsuccessful run for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat two years ago, Oz pushed for “Medicare Advantage For All,” which would allow seniors to choose privately run health insurance plansEarly in the pandemic, Oz pushed unproven theories about COVID-19 cures, including the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as treatment, which caught Trump’s eye.Before entering politics, he was a heart surgeon and health expert on Oprah Winfrey’s show. Oz later appeared on his own show, known for providing medical tips and leaning into so-called alternative and complementary medicine. Oz is not the first television fixture to be selected for a key role in the Administration; Pete Hegseth (Defense secretary) is co-host of Fox & Friends. Trump announced that he has selected Howard Lutnick, the billionaire CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, to serve as his Secretary of Commerce. A vocal supporter of Trump’s economic policies, Lutnick has been an influential figure within the President-elect’s circle, advising on trade and economic matters throughout the transition process. He won the endorsement of Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla in Trump’s inner circle, for Treasury Secretary, but on Tuesday Trump tapped him for Commerce instead. In a statement, Trump praised Lutnick as a “dynamic force on Wall Street” and credited him with building a robust system to staff the incoming administration.If confirmed by the Senate, Lutnick, 63, would oversee an agency tasked with expanding U.S. economic growth, boosting domestic industries, regulating artificial intelligence, and managing the implementation of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which provides subsidies to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. It’s unclear whether the Trump Administration will proceed with disbursing the funds agreed to under current Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, as the Commerce Department has yet to release much of the allocated money despite having signed agreements with U.S. chipmakers. Lutnick would also inherit the Biden Administration’s broadband expansion initiative aimed at providing internet access to at least 6.25 million households by 2025.Given his extensive business holdings, Lutnick could face scrutiny over his finances and potential conflicts of interest during the confirmation process. In addition to being CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is chairman of BGC Group Inc, a brokerage company, and of Newmark Group, a commercial real estate company.Trump has tapped former congressman from Wisconsin and TV personality Sean Duffy to run the Transportation Department.Upon the announcement of his nomination Duffy, 53, parted ways with Fox, where he was a co-host of The Bottom Line on Fox Business and a contributor on Fox News. A former outdoor games athlete, Duffy has also worked as a commentator on ESPN and in the 1990s appeared on several MTV reality shows, where he met his wife. He then served for eight years as a prosecutor followed by eight years as a U.S. representative after his election in 2010 as part of the conservative populist Tea Party wave. Duffy left Congress in 2019 to focus on family health matters. Trump encouraged him to run for governor of Wisconsin in 2022, but he declined.If confirmed to the post, Duffy will succeed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg to head a department that oversees highways, railroads, aviation and other transportation systems, with a budget of about $110 billion. In his statement announcing the nomination, Trump said Duffy “will prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America’s highways, tunnels, bridges and airports. He will ensure our ports and dams serve our Economy without compromising our National Security, and he will make our skies safe again by eliminating DEI for pilots and air traffic controllers.”Trump announced that Brendan Carr will become chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the regulator of interstate and international communications. Since Carr is already on the commission, he can assume control when Trump takes office in January. Carr, whom Trump first nominated to the commission in 2017 and who has previously served as its general counsel, wrote the FCC chapter of the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025 presidential transition playbook. In it, he argued that the FCC should expand its oversight, aim to rein in Big Tech, ban TikTok in the U.S. on national security grounds, and roll back protections for tech companies under Section 230 of the Communications Act. “Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft & others have played central roles in the censorship cartel,” he posted on X last week. “The censorship cartel must be dismantled.”Carr is also publicly aligned with Elon Musk. He criticized the FCC’s refusal to finalize nearly $900 million in rural broadband subsidies for Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink, and his appointment could open up federal funding for it.“Commissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans’ Freedoms, and held back our Economy,” Trump said in a statement. “He will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America’s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.”Chris Wright, Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Energy, is the CEO of Denver-based fracking company Liberty Energy who has downplayed the effects of the climate crisis and is likely to be a vocal player in the administration against measures that aim to cut carbon emissions—if his appointment is confirmed by the Senate.In a LinkedIn video posted a year ago, Wright said: “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” In a May petroleum conference, Wright said that climate change “should be treated honestly and evaluated as trade-offs not as a religion or a cult, which unfortunately it's become.” In October, he acknowledged that climate change is a “real background phenomenon” that is “wildly misrepresented for political, media, all sorts of other reasons.”Wright, who has no prior political experience but was reportedly pushed for the role by Trump donor Harold Hamm, also sits on the Board of Directors for nuclear power start-up Oklo Inc. In the statement announcing Wright’s selection, Trump said Wright will also be a member of the new National Energy Council which will involve multiple departments and agencies and will focus on establishing “U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE.”Trump selected another of his personal legal defense team, William Owen Scharf, to join his administration. Scharf will take on the post of White House Staff Secretary and assistant to the President. Scharf represented Trump in his federal election interference case and his presidential immunity case, and he previously worked both in and out of the government during Trump’s first term on securing the confirmations of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Scharf, a former prosecutor, ran for Missouri Attorney General earlier this year but fell short in the GOP primary.Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, was named White House communications director, taking on a post that saw high turnover during the first Trump administration—with Trump having six during his first term. Cheung also worked on Trump’s first campaign and was director of strategic response during his first term. Prior to that, he worked as a spokesperson for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Sergio Gor, who co-founded a conservative publishing house with Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and ran a super PAC that spent tens of millions of dollars in support of Trump’s campaign, will lead the Presidential Personnel Office—which is responsible for helping to recruit, vet, and nominate some 4,000 political appointees throughout government.Trump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt will become the main liaison between members of the press and the incoming President. Leavitt, 27, will be the youngest-ever White House press secretary and the sixth woman in a row to hold the role. She was assistant press secretary during Trump’s first term. In 2022, she ran for Congress to represent a New Hampshire district but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.“Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Trump said in a statement. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.”Trump has tapped North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior in his upcoming Administration, elevating (if confirmed) a former Republican presidential primary rival turned staunch ally and even onetime running mate contender. The announcement was first made during an America First Policy Institute Gala at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on Nov. 14, following speculation about Burgum’s future role in the Administration. “He’s going to head the Department of Interior, and it’s going to be fantastic,” Trump said.The next day, Trump formally announced his selection in a statement, saying that Burgum will also head the new National Energy Council and have a seat on the National Security Council, a position not typically granted to the Interior Secretary. “Doug will be a key leader in ushering in a new ‘Golden Age of American Prosperity’ and World Peace,” Trump said.Burgum’s selection to head the Interior Department has raised eyebrows due to his lack of direct experience in environmental policy or natural resource management. However, his business background—he’s a former Microsoft executive—and ties to the energy sector could make him an attractive choice for an Administration eager to prioritize energy independence and deregulation. A former software entrepreneur, Burgum sold his tech company to Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion and spent several years as a senior vice president at the tech giant. His business acumen and relationships with key players in the energy industry have positioned him as a figure who could help advance Trump’s pro-energy, pro-business agenda. Burgum’s nomination would bring a decidedly corporate flair to the Department of the Interior, an agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and natural resources.Trump nominated Doug Collins, the former Republican congressman from Georgia, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a critical post tasked with overseeing the welfare of the nation’s more than 15 million veterans. Collins, a staunch Trump ally and former ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, has shown unwavering loyalty to Trump, particularly during the impeachment proceedings in the House and the fallout from the 2020 election. Collins was an Air Force Reserve chaplain who served in Iraq.Should he be confirmed in his new role, Collins will inherit a department grappling with both budget shortfalls and a controversial electronic health records overhaul that has been plagued by delays and safety concerns. The VA’s responsibility for providing care to veterans exposed to toxic substances, such as Agent Orange, was expanded by bipartisan legislation in 2022. In a statement on social media, Collins pledged to streamline operations, cut regulations, and address corruption within the department, promising to deliver “world class care” to veterans. “Together, we’ll make the VA work for those who fought for us,” he said.Trump has selected John Sauer, a key member of his legal defense team, to serve as the next U.S. Solicitor General. A former federal prosecutor and Missouri's Solicitor General from 2017 to 2023, is perhaps best known for his successful defense of Trump in a landmark Supreme Court case securing presidential immunity. The ruling, which found that a sitting President could not be prosecuted for official acts, was a critical victory for Trump amid ongoing legal challenges related to the 2020 election. Sauer had also urged the Supreme Court to intervene to keep Trump in power by challenging the 2020 election results in several crucial swing states.If confirmed as Solicitor General, Sauer will represent the federal government in key Supreme Court cases, including contentious matters involving transgender rights and gun control. “John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,” Trump said in a statement. The nomination reflects Trump’s deep reliance on his inner circle of legal allies, particularly those who have defended him against multiple investigations. Trump has picked his personal lawyer Todd Blanche to serve as deputy attorney general. The nomination is a significant move within Trump’s strategy of placing loyal allies in top Justice Department roles. Blanche, who spent years as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is credited with playing a pivotal role in defending Trump in several high-profile cases, including as the lead attorney in the New York hush-money trial that resulted in Trump’s conviction and in the cases related to his handling of classified documents and efforts to challenge the 2020 election results.In his new role, Blanche would oversee the daily operations of the Justice Department, manage its policy priorities, and help advise Attorney General Matt Gaetz if he’s confirmed by the Senate.Trump has selected Emil Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. A former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove worked alongside Blanche on Trump’s defense team in the Manhattan hush-money case and the federal investigations into mishandling classified documents and election subversion. Bove joins a growing group of Trump allies in key legal positions, reinforcing the President-elect’s strategy of relying on trusted figures in his upcoming Administration.“Emil is a tough and strong attorney, who will be a crucial part of the Justice Department, rooting out corruption and crime,” Trump said in a statement.Trump has selected Jay Clayton, the former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), an influential post known for its aggressive pursuit of high-profile financial and political corruption cases. If confirmed, Clayton, who has no criminal prosecution experience, would inherit a number of high-profile cases, including investigations into New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the prosecution of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat. Trump described Clayton as a “highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant,” pointing to his years of experience in the financial world, where he was known for his work in mergers and acquisitions before taking over at the SEC in 2017.Clayton’s tenure at the SEC was largely characterized by a pro-business approach, which included efforts to roll back certain regulations on Wall Street and to develop clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency investments. His leadership also saw significant enforcement actions, including a high-profile case against Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who will co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, for misleading statements about taking the company private. This will be Clayton's second attempt at taking the SDNY post, after a contentious attempt in 2020 to replace Geoffrey Berman, who held the position during part of Trump’s first term. At that time, his nomination faced resistance from both inside the Justice Department and from Democratic lawmakers who feared political interference, particularly because SDNY had been investigating Trump’s associates, including his former lawyers Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani. The SDNY has long been a thorn in the side of political figures, including Trump himself, who was investigated for his role in the 2016 hush-money payments, a case that led to his conviction in New York State court. During his campaign, Trump vowed to exact revenge against the officials who prosecuted him.Trump has picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The appointment comes less than three months after Kennedy dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Trump.Kennedy, 70, is known for his vocal opposition to vaccines, particularly his longstanding claims linking vaccinations to autism—a theory debunked by decades of scientific research. His views, which have earned him both fervent supporters and sharp critics, now position him at the helm of the very agency responsible for overseeing the nation’s health regulations.Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. The nomination marks a dramatic departure from conventional selections for the position, and it is likely to test the Senate's willingness to confirm yet another controversial figure. In his new role, Kennedy is expected to have significant influence over key health agencies within HHS, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). His past rhetoric, which includes calls for removing fluoride from drinking water and restructuring the National Institutes of Health (NIH), suggests that his tenure could lead to sweeping changes in federal health policy, especially around vaccine safety and food regulation. Kennedy has tempered some of his more extreme positions in recent interviews, such as assuring the public that he would not “take vaccines away from anybody,” but his broader agenda remains focused on revisiting vaccine safety studies and challenging longstanding health guidelines, particularly those related to childhood immunizations.Although Kennedy’s appointment has raised alarms among public health experts, Trump has expressed confidence in his new nominee’s ability to reshape the nation's health system. Trump said in a statement that Kennedy would “restore these agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research” and “end the Chronic Disease epidemic.”Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress, was selected by Trump to serve as Director of National Intelligence. The position will require Senate confirmation. Gabbard served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was a member of the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees. After running for President as a Democrat in 2019, she left the Democratic Party to become an independent. She joined the Republican Party in 2024 and endorsed Trump for President, co-chairing his transition team.Read More: ‘We Are Reeling’: Trump’s Pick of Tulsi Gabbard Alarms Intelligence CommunityFlorida Senator Marco Rubio has been named Secretary of State. Rubio currently serves as the vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and sits on the Foreign Relations Committee. He was a vocal critic of Trump in 2016 during his own presidential bid, but went on to endorse and campaign for him in 2024. Rubio has taken a hardline stance on China and Iran, and has called for an end of the war in Ukraine with a “negotiated settlement.” The role requires Senate confirmation.Longtime Trump advisor Stephen Miller was named deputy chief of staff for policy, which Trump’s Vice President-elect J.D. Vance had already confirmed in a post on X. The role does not require Senate confirmation.Miller worked with Trump on his 2016 campaign and then joined him in the White House as a senior adviser. He orchestrated some of the first Trump Administration’s controversial immigration policies, including the “zero tolerance” family separation policy. Upon leaving the White House, he started America First Legal, a conservative legal nonprofit, which targeted many Biden Administration initiatives.Dan Scavino, a key figure in Trump’s political orbit for nearly a decade, has been appointed as deputy chief of staff and assistant to the President. Scavino first worked for Trump as a caddy at one of his golf courses, and has risen through the ranks to become one of Trump’s most trusted and longest-serving aides. He played a central role in shaping Trump’s media presence, first as social media director for the 2016 campaign and later as the White House’s director of social media during Trump’s first term. In his new role, Scavino will likely continue to wield significant influence over both the day-to-day operations of the White House and Trump’s public messaging strategy.In 2022, he was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House committee investigating the January 6th Capitol insurrection, though the Department of Justice declined to prosecute him.James Blair has been appointed as deputy chief of staff for legislative, political, and public affairs, a role that will place him at the heart of Trump’s political strategy and legislative agenda. Blair previously served as political director for both Trump’s 2024 campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC), and was also a top aide for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He played a pivotal role in crafting Trump’s economic messaging during his campaign, including the "Trump can fix it" slogan. Blair will also serve as an assistant to the President.Taylor Budowich has been appointed as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, placing him at the forefront of Trump’s public relations and staffing strategies. A veteran of Trump’s political operations, Budowich launched and directed Make America Great Again, Inc., the pro-Trump Super PAC that supported his 2024 bid. He also served as the spokesperson for Trump after his first term, working closely with the Save America PAC to shape the narrative surrounding Trump’s post-White House political activities.The governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem, will be the next Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The agency oversees everything from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Secret Service.“She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries,” Trump said in a statement sharing the pick.A Trump loyalist, Noem was an outspoken opponent of COVID-19 safety measures and has historically taken a hardline stance on immigration. She was expected to be a front-runner for Trump’s Vice President pick in 2024, but faced controversy for admitting in her book, No Going Back, that she killed her 14-month-old dog after it ruined a hunt, killed another family’s chickens, and moved to bite her.Trump announced that his prominent supporter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE, for short). In a statement, Trump shared that the two will work from outside the government but partner with the White House and Office of Management and Budget to “drive large scale structural reform and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.” Trump said that the two will finish their work by July 4, 2026.Ramaswamy, who ran in the Republican primary before dropping out and endorsing Trump, made reducing government spending a key part of his campaign. During his campaign, Trump also mentioned the possibility of giving Musk, who has said he could cut nearly a third of annual government spending, a role in the Administration.As co-host of Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends, Pete Hegseth is an untraditional choice for Secretary of Defense. “I am honored to announce that I have nominated Pete Hegseth to serve in my Cabinet as The Secretary of Defense,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First.” If confirmed, Hegseth, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and at Guantanamo Bay, will take on the job amidst a number of global crises—including the Israel-Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia conflict.Trump said he will name John Ratcliffe to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), pending confirmation by the Senate. Ratcliffe served as a Texas congressman from 2015 to 2020, before joining the first Trump Administration as Director of National Intelligence. While in Congress, he served as a member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees and as Cybersecurity Chairman on the Homeland Security Committee. Ratcliffe, who received a National Security Medal from Trump in 2020, testified in front of a grand jury as part of a criminal probe into the aftermath of the 2020 election, and warned White House staffers against following through with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to a former White House staffer.William Joseph McGinley, who served as White House Cabinet secretary in the first Trump Administration, will serve as Trump’s White House counsel. McGinley most recently worked as an outside counsel for the Republican National Committee’s election integrity team during the 2024 election.“Bill is a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement,” Trump said in a statement announcing the decision.Trump has appointed real estate executive and philanthropist Steven Witkoff as his special envoy to the Middle East, tapping a close personal ally and major campaign fundraiser for a role that could shape U.S. foreign policy in the region. Witkoff, the chairman and CEO of Witkoff Group, played a key role in rallying financial backing for Trump from Jewish donors, particularly during tensions with the Biden Administration over military support for Israel.Trump praised Witkoff’s business acumen and philanthropic efforts, calling him an “unrelenting Voice for PEACE,” while noting his ability to make “every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous.” Witkoff was golfing with Trump at Trump’s club in West Palm Beach, Florida in September when the former President was the target of a second assassination attempt.The special envoy role remains somewhat undefined compared to traditional diplomatic positions. Witkoff has no prior experience in foreign diplomacy. He has been an outspoken advocate for Trump’s Middle East policies, praising the former President for his efforts to strengthen Israel's position and curb Iran’s influence. Witkoff is also set to co-chair Trump’s inaugural committee.Trump has selected former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel, tapping a loyal ally for the high-profile diplomatic position with the region in crisis. If confirmed by the Senate, Huckabee will step into the role as Israel wages a multifront war against Iran’s proxies and a humanitarian catastrophe unfolds in Gaza.A staunch defender of Israel and a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Huckabee has long been a proponent of U.S. policies that align with Israeli interests, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy to the city. His appointment signals a continuation of Trump’s support for Israel, particularly in its conflict with Hamas and its broader territorial claims.“Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,” Trump said in a statement. “He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!”An evangelical Christian, Huckabee would be the first non-Jewish person to hold the role since 2011. Huckabee has consistently dismissed the notion of Palestinian statehood within Israeli borders, suggesting in the past that any Palestinian state should be established in neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan. During his 2008 presidential campaign, he said, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.” He has also signaled that he opposes negotiating a ceasefire deal with Hamas, calling on the Islamist militant group to surrender.Huckabee’s daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the current Governor of Arkansas and served as White House press secretary during Trump’s first term.Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman from Florida, was tapped to serve as Trump’s national security advisor. Waltz, a Green Beret veteran who served in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa, has been a member of Congress since 2019. He is a member of the House’s China Task Force, along with the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees. Waltz, widely known for his aggressive stance on China and Iran, will step into the role amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Last year, he wrote an op-ed for Fox News in which he argued that “the era of Ukraine’s blank check from Congress is over.” He, like Trump, has also called for European countries to contribute more to NATO. The role does not require Senate confirmation.“Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength,” Trump said in a statement.Trump nominated New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik has been a critic of the U.N., in particular over the organization’s stance on Israel, saying last month that the Biden Administration should consider a “complete reassessment” of U.S. funding of the U.N. given the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to expel Israel from the General Assembly. Stefanik has been a vocal supporter of Trump, during both of his impeachment trials and as he contested the results of the 2020 election. She has ascended the party’s ranks, serving as chair of the House Republican Conference, the fourth highest position in House GOP leadership. Stefanik’s appointment will need to be confirmed by the Senate.Trump has picked Lee Zeldin, a former New York representative, to serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The position is subject to Senate confirmation. Zeldin said he would “restore U.S. energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,” while committing to clean air and water, in a statement posted on X.Zeldin represented a district spanning from Long Island to the Hamptons while in Congress from 2015-2023 and previously served as a major in the Army Reserve. Zeldin was a staunch defender of Trump during his first term and sided with him during both impeachments. Zeldin most recently ran against New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in the state’s 2022 gubernatorial race.Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was appointed as “border czar,” a role that will likely be involved in Trump’s plan for mass deportations of millions of undocumented migrants. Homan, a former police officer, will be in charge of the southern and northern U.S. borders, as well as “all Maritime and Aviation Security,” according to Trump’s post on Truth Social. Homan also served in Trump’s first term—acting as ICE director from January 2017 to June 2018—and played a role in Trump’s crackdown on immigration, as one of the architects of the administration’s controversial child separation policy. The role will not require Senate confirmation.Susie Wiles, Trump’s 2024 campaign manager, was named White House chief of staff soon after Election Day, in the first major staffing decision. A longtime Republican strategist and campaign staffer, Wiles worked on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign and managed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ winning gubernatorial campaign in 2018. Wiles, who Trump referred to as the “ice maiden” in his election night victory speech, will be the first woman to serve as chief of staff.—With additional reporting by Solcyré Burga and Rebecca Schneid.WRITE TO SIMMONE SHAH AT SIMMONE.SHAH@TIME.COM AND NIK POPLI AT NIK.POPLI@TIME.COM

ith the general election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump upon us, endorsements from high-profile figures hold much significance. Especially those that involve crossing party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former Governor of California, spoke out on Wednesday, Oct. 30, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), endorsing Harris over Trump. He joins a growing number of Republicans who have decided to vote Democrat this November.Here is a list of the prominent Republicans crossing party lines and voting for Harris over Trump in the 2024 election: Actor and former Governor of California Schwarzenegger endorsed Democratic nominee Harris for President over his fellow Republican, Trump, in a lengthy social media post. Schwarzenegger said he does not typically give endorsements, as he doesn’t “trust most politicians,” but he understands why people want to know his opinions since he is “not just a celebrity,” but also a former Governor.“To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a [sic] trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious,” he wrote. “And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”“I’m sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do,” he elaborated. “You don’t recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.”On Sept. 6, Former Vice President and influential Republican Dick Cheney released a statement announcing his endorsement of Harris for President. Speaking out against the Republican nominee, Cheney said that Trump can “never be trusted with power again.”Cheney, who served as Vice President under President George W. Bush between 2001 and 2009, went on to say that American citizens have a “duty” to prioritize the nation over partisan politics.“In our nation’s 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in his statement. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” he continued, referencing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.Dick Cheney’s endorsement came a week after his daughter, former Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney said that she’d vote for Harris.“As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares deeply about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses—not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” Cheney said on Sept. 4 at a Sanford School of Public Policy event at Duke University in North Carolina.Cheney served as vice-chair of the Jan. 6 committee and was one of two Republicans on the panel—something that Trump called to have her jailed for.Former Illinois Rep. and Republican Adam Kinzinger became a staunch critic of Trump after the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and spoke about endorsing Harris on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago in August. He encouraged other Republicans who wish to “defend democracy and decency” to do the same.“I was a Republican for 12 years in Congress, and I still hold on to the label,” he said. “I know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and democracy, and she is dedicated to upholding all three in service to our country.”Anthony Scaramucci, the businessman who served as White House Director of Communications under Trump for 10 days in 2017, endorsed Harris, and has even said he is working alongside Harris on her campaign’s crypto policies.“Kamala Harris is capable and has a great team,” he said in July, via a social media post.Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan spoke at the DNC, arguing that he stands in front of the crowd “as an American” though he is a Republican too. He focused his speech on other Republicans who may be watching, saying that the “party is not civil or conservative. It’s chaotic and crazy.” Duncan referred to Trump as a “direct threat to democracy.”“To my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back towards policy, empathy, and tone, you know the right thing to do. Now let’s have the courage to do it in November,” he said.Republican former Senator and Arizona representative Jeff Flake posted a statement to X on Sept. 29, announcing his support of the Harriz-Walz ticket, though he still calls himself a “conservative Republican.” He noted that he served with both Harris and Walz in Congress and that he knows “first hand” how much they love America.“I want to support a Presidential candidate who seeks to unite our country rather than one who divides us,” he wrote. “In times like these, there is nothing more conservative than putting country over party.”More than 200 Republicans who worked for both Bush Presidents, the late Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Mitt Romney released an open letter in August, declaring endorsement of Harris. In their letter, which was first reported by USA Today, the former staff members wrote that they were reiterating the 2020 decision by George W. Bush, McCain, and Romney alumni to “warn” against re-electing Trump. Now, they are “reuniting” to endorse Harris in 2024. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected,” they wrote. “The alternative, however, is simply untenable.”Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales endorsed Harris in an opinion piece published by Politico on Sept. 12.“As the United States approaches a critical election, I can’t sit quietly as Donald Trump—perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation—eyes a return to the White House,” he wrote, pointing specifically to the events of Jan. 6. “For that reason, though I’m a Republican, I’ve decided to support Kamala Harris for President.”Former Representative Denver Riggleman, who represented Virginia as a Republican, has endorsed Harris. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Aug. 9, Riggleman said: “What’s really going on is I think truth and facts need to be the baseline for this election. You can’t have an inveterate liar as President of the United States… It’s not about policy but the real reasons why Republicans should have the permission structure to vote for the Democratic ticket.”Former Michigan Republican Congressman Fred Upton, who served for three decades in the House of Representatives, endorsed Harris on Oct. 24“Watching Trump day after day, he's ignored the advice of many senior, respected Republicans to stay on the issues,” Upton told The Detroit News. “Instead, he's still talking about the election being stolen, trashing women left and right. He's just totally unhinged. We don't need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that's why I'm where I am.”Upton retired in 2022 after voting to impeach Trump the year before.Former New Hampshire Attorney General, Republican Tom Rath spoke to a local news station during the final week of October, stating that this is an “extraordinary moment in our history,” and explaining his endorsement of Harris."I think this is an election that completely oversteps any partisan identification," Rath said. "This is not a Republican vote or a Democratic vote. This is a vote that speaks to what we want ourselves to be and what we want our government to be."Former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey also shared strong words against Trump.“He's dangerous to our safety, dangerous to peace, dangerous to democracy and freedom,” Humphrey, who served two terms in the Senate from 1979-1990, said in the same local news interview with Rath. “I voted for Republicans for more than 50 years. I can't vote for Trump, as a father, as a grandfather, as a veteran, as a former U.S. Senator.”Former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who also served as Melania Trump’s Chief of Staff, appeared at the DNC, where she shared that Harris “has [her] vote.”At the convention, Grisham—who resigned after Jan 6.—took to the stage and said she felt  “very strongly” about speaking out.“I love my country more than my party,” Grisham said. “Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote.”Jimmy McCain, son of former Arizona Senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, endorsed Harris in September, also stating that he had changed his voter registration to Democrat.“She’ll bring everyone together. She'll bring that moderation, that bipartisanship that we've been missing for so long,” McCain told 12 News on Sept. 8, sharing that the Trump campaign’s conduct at Arlington National Cemetery was what instigated his Harris endorsement.State Senator for Wisconsin’s 2nd District, Republican Robert Cowles called Trump a “totalitarian” in an interview with Rational Revolution on Oct. 24, and stated he would be voting for Harris. Cowles said he is “ready” for the blowback of publicly announcing his decision. “We have to make a change here and Trump has to be defeated and we have to protect the Constitution and the country will go on, even with some liberal things that Harris might do,” he said.John Giles, Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, shared his endorsement of Harris in an opinion piece for the Arizona Republic in July. Giles has been Mayor of the third largest city in Arizona, a notable swing state in the upcoming election, since 2014.“The Republican Party with Trump at its helm continues down the path of political extremism, away from focusing on our fundamental freedoms,” Giles wrote in the op-ed. He went on to argue that Trump did not support Arizona cities and that Harris is the “competent, just, and fair leader” that the country “deserves."Former Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush, John Negroponte announced his support for Harris in a September letter signed by over 100 former national security officials from Republican Administrations and former Republican members of Congress.In the letter, the signatories wrote that they “expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues,” but they still “believe she possesses the essential qualities to serve as President and Donald Trump does not.” William Webster, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, was another  signatory of the letter with Negroponte. The letter also said that they “firmly oppose the election of Donald Trump,” arguing that as President he “promoted daily chaos in government, praised our enemies and undermined our allies, politicized the military and disparaged our veterans.”Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence, also signed the letter with Webster and Negroponte, endorsing Harris.Beyond that, Troye—who left the Trump-led White House in 2020—spoke at the DNC. There, she urged fellow Republicans to vote for Harris.“To my fellow Republicans: you aren't voting for a Democrat, you're voting for democracy,” she said. “You aren't betraying your party, you're standing up for our country.” Troye also wrote an opinion piece for MSNBC in which she called herself a “lifelong Republican,” but added that for President, there is “only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.”CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: The new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is taking shape, with several contentious hires in his proposed administration.Ahead of his return to the White House on 20 January 2025, the president-elect has named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and military veteran, as his pick for defence secretary. And he wants Robert F Kennedy Jr to be health secretary.Marco Rubio could be the next secretary of state. And billionaire supporter Elon Musk will play a role in cost-cutting.Here is a closer look at the posts he has named replacements for, and the names in the mix for the top jobs yet to be filled.We will start with the cabinet roles, which require approval from the US Senate. If four Republican senators and all the Democrats disagree to any individual then that nomination will fail.Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been picked for US secretary of state - the president's main adviser on foreign affairs, who acts as America's top diplomat when representing the country overseas.Rubio, 53, takes a hawkish view of China. He opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences.He has long been courting the job of the nation's top diplomat and if approved, he will be the first Latino secretary of state in US history.Pete Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host who has never held political office, has been nominated to be the next defence secretary.His appointment is one of the most highly anticipated in Trump's cabinet as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza rage on. "Nobody fights harder for the troops," Trump said.After Hegseth's appointment, it emerged that he was investigated in 2017 for an alleged sexual assault. He was never arrested or charged and denies the allegation.His lawyer also confirmed that he had paid a woman in the same year to stay quiet about an assault claim that he feared would cost him his job at Fox. Again, he denied any wrongdoing.Trump's first pick for attorney general, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration for the role Thursday after a week of controversy over a congressional investigation into sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him.Gaetz denied all of the claims, but said he wanted to avoid a "needlessly protracted Washington scuffle."About six hours after Gaetz withdrew, Trump named Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, as his successor."Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families," Trump wrote.Bondi served during Trump's first administration as a member of the Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission. And she was on his defence team during his first impeachment trial.Trump announced during a speech at Mar-a-Lago that he would ask Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to lead the Department of the Interior.A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth.If confirmed, Burgum will oversee an agency that is responsible for the management and conservation of federal lands and natural resources.RFK Jr, as he is known, an environmental lawyer, vaccine sceptic and the nephew of former President John F Kennedy, is Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Despite having no medical qualifications, Kennedy, 70, would have broad remit over US federal health agencies - including those that oversee approval of vaccines and pharmaceuticals.There has been speculation about his inability to pass a background check for security clearance due to past controversies, including dumping a bear carcass in New York's Central Park.Some of Kennedy’s own stated aims for government are bound up with misinformation - and many medical experts have expressed serious concerns about his nomination, citing his views on vaccines and other health matters.On other matters he has more support, for example in scrutinising the processing of food and the use of additives.Trump has nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration.The FDA is responsible for the safety of prescription drugs and vaccines as well as oversight of food and cosmetics."The Agency needs Dr. Marty Makary, a Highly Respected Johns Hopkins Surgical Oncologist and Health Policy Expert, to course-correct and refocus the Agency," Trump said in a statement Friday.Dr Makary is a Johns Hopkins University professor, author and surgeon, and he is a trained cancer specialist. He spoke to conservative media outlets during the Covid-29 pandemic, questioning the need for masks and expressing concerns over the Covid vaccine among young children. The American Academy of Pediatrics' stance was that even though the Covid death rate was low among young children, vaccinations helped reduce severe disease in children.Trump announced in his nomination that Dr Makary would be ideal to "course-correct and refocus the Agency"."FDA has lost the trust of Americans, and has lost sight of its primary goal as a regulator," he said.Dr Makary would require Senate approval and would serve under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, if both are confirmed.Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins has been chosen to lead the US Department of Veterans' Affairs.Collins was a Trump loyalist when he served in Congress from 2013-21. He was an outspoken advocate for the president-elect during both impeachment hearings.An Iraq war veteran who now serves as a chaplain in the US Air Force Reserve, Collins left Congress for an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in his home state of Georgia.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has been nominated for the key role of overseeing US security, including its borders, cyber-threats, terrorism and emergency response.The agency has a $62bn (£48bn) budget and employs thousands of people. It incorporates a wide variety of agencies under its umbrella, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Former congressman and Fox Business host Sean Duffy has been selected to lead the Department of Transportation.If confirmed by senators, he will take charge of aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at the transport department, with a roughly $110bn annual budget.In the role, the incoming secretary can expect to face a number of safety-related aviation issues, including the continued problems at Boeing, as the troubled manufacturer addresses a series of safety and quality issues.Oil and gas industry executive Chris Wright will lead the Department of Energy, where he is expected to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to "drill, baby, drill" and maximise US energy production.Wright, the founder-CEO of Liberty Energy, has called climate activists alarmist and likened Democrats' push for renewables to Soviet-style communism.In a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year, he said: "There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either."Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump's transition team and chief executive of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, has been picked to lead the US commerce department.Trump said Lutnick would spearhead the administration's "tariff and trade agenda".Lutnick had also been in the running for treasury secretary, a more high-profile role.World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) co-founder and Trump transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, has been appointed as Trump's nominee for education secretary.A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign.Trump has criticised the Department of Education, and has promised to close the agency down - a job McMahon could be tasked with.In his statement announcing her nomination, Trump said McMahon would "spearhead" the effort to "send Education BACK TO THE STATES", in reference to the pledge.Scott Bessent has been nominated to lead the US Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for liberal billionaire George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and would bring a relatively conventional resume to the role.On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a "new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes"."[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda," Trump said, adding that Bessent would "support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances."Russell Vought has been selected to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a post he held during Trump's first term.Vought previously served as the director of the agency, which helps craft the president's budget, acts as the central regulatory gatekeeper and executes the president's agenda across the government.He also authored a key chapter in Project 2025, a 900-page conservative wish-list that sought to expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision.Vought served as the Republican National Committee’s 2024 platform policy director."He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term," Trump said in announcing Vought. "We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!"Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been selected by Trump to lead the US Department of Labor - which oversees worker health and safety, workforce laws and administers unemployment and workers compensation.Chavez-DeRemer has been serving in the US Congress since 2023 but lost a re-election bid in Oregon in the November election, despite winning strong trade union support.Scott Turner, an NFL veteran and motivational speaker, has been chosen to lead the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.The department oversees America's housing needs, enforces laws, prevents discrimination and provides assistance to those in need, through both low-income housing and helping Americans avoid foreclosure.Turner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term. He previously served in the Texas legislature.Brooke Rollins grew up on a farm, but her most recent job was as co-founder and head of the America First Policy Institute, a Maga-backed think tank.During the president-elect's first administration, she served as director of the Office of American Innovation and acting director of the Domestic Policy Council.According to Trump's press release, Rollins graduated from the Texas A&M University with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in agriculture development and later obtained her law degree from the same university.As agriculture secretary, she will be oversee farm subsidies, federal nutrition programmes, meat inspections and other facets of the country's agricultural industry.Outside the 15 department heads who make up the core of the cabinet, there are several other roles that are often given cabinet-rank, like the FBI director and the head of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). These roles will also require the nominees to be confirmed by the Senate.However, there will be other key roles in the Trump administration that will not require Senate confirmation and the people filling these roles - like Elon Musk - will not have to be vetted in the same way.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has been tapped to lead what Trump has termed a Department of Government Efficiency, alongside one-time presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy.The department - whose acronym Doge is a nod to a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk - will serve in an advisory capacity to "dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies", Trump said.It is unclear what approval process will be necessary for these roles.This is a critical job because it includes responsibility for Trump's mass deportations of millions of undocumented migrants, which was a central campaign pledge.Homan is a former police officer who was acting director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Trump's first term and has advocated a zero-tolerance stance on the issue."I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen," he said in July.Lee Zeldin, a former New York congressman, has agreed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), both he and Trump said. The Senate will still need to confirm his appointment.He will be in charge of tackling America's climate policy in this role.While serving in congress from 2015 to 2023, Zeldin voted against expanding a number of environmental policies. He has already said he plans to "roll back regulations" from day one.New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been tapped to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations.Stefanik has made national headlines with her sharp questioning in congressional committees.Trump has chosen his former director of national intelligence, ex-Texas congressman John Ratcliffe, to serve as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director.There are other yet-to-be-appointed key positions running intelligence agencies, including the FBI and director of national intelligence.Trump has said he would fire FBI Director Chris Wray, whom he nominated in 2017, but has since fallen out with. Jeffrey Jensen, a former Trump-appointed US attorney, has been under consideration to replace Wray.Trump has named former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard, as director of national intelligence.The former US Army Reserve officer once campaigned with Senator Bernie Sanders and ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, but has turned toward the Republicans in recent years.She campaigned with Trump in 2024 and served on his transition team.Florida congressman Michael Waltz has been selected as the next national security adviser.In a statement on Tuesday announcing Waltz's appointment, Trump noted that Waltz is the first green beret - or member of the US Army Special Forces - to be elected to Congress.Waltz will have to help navigate the US position on the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.Trump has picked real estate investor and philanthropist Steve Witkoff for the role of special envoy to the Middle East.Witkoff is a close friend of Trump's, who was with the former president when a man allegedly tried to assassinate him at his Palm Beach golf club in September.Trump has described him as a "highly respected leader in business and philanthropy, who has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous".Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be US ambassador to Israel, as Trump pledges to end the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.“Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years," the president-elect said in a statement.Huckabee is a staunchly pro-Israel official who has previously rejected the idea of a two-state solution to solve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has been nominated to be the US Ambassador to Nato - the alliance Trump has regularly criticised, and has even previously threatened to withdraw from completely."Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended," Trump said in a statement."Matt will strengthen relationships with our Nato Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST."Whitaker is a high school football star turned lawyer who has served as a US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. He has little experience of foreign policy.Trump has selected Dean John Sauer to be US solicitor general to supervise and conduct government litigation in the US Supreme Court.Sauer previously served as solicitor general for the Missouri state supreme court for six years, and worked as a clerk for former US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.He also represented Trump earlier this year in several of his court cases, including his US Supreme Court immunity case.Brendan Carr is a current member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates broadcast and internet use. A longtime establishment Republican, in recent years he has embraced Trump's priorities and emerged as a supporter of regulation of "big tech"."Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others have played central roles in the censorship cartel," he wrote on X. "The censorship cartel must be dismantled."Trump has previously vowed to strip TV channels he considers biased of their broadcasting licenses.Mehmet Oz has been chosen to run the powerful agency that oversees the healthcare of millions of Americans. He, too, will need to be confirmed by the US Senate next year before he officially takes charge.Oz trained as a surgeon before finding fame on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the early 2000s. He later hosted a TV programme of his own.“There may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr Oz to make America healthy again," Trump said.Oz has been criticised by experts for promoting what they called bad health advice about weight loss drugs and "miracle" cures, and suggesting malaria drugs as a cure for Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic.These jobs are in the West Wing - his key advisers.Susie Wiles and campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita were the masterminds behind Trump's victory over Kamala Harris.The chief of staff is a cabinet member and often a president's top aide, overseeing daily operations in the West Wing and managing the boss's staff.Wiles, 67, has worked in Republican politics for decades, from Ronald Reagan’s successful 1980 presidential campaign to electing Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis as governors of Florida.Stephen Miller, who has been Trump’s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump’s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration.During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.Republican lawyer William McGinley will take on the role of White House counsel, Trump has said.“Bill is a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement,” he said in a statement.McGinley served as White House cabinet secretary during part of Trump’s first term and was the Republican National Committee’s counsel for election integrity in 2024.Karoline Leavitt, 27, will become the youngest person to serve as White House press secretary in US history when Donald Trump returns to office.She ran for Congress, winning the Republican nomination for New Hampshire in 2022, only to lose in the general election to Democrat Chris Pappas.Leavitt also served in the White House press office during the first Trump administration, including as an assistant press secretary, according to the website for her run for Congress.The public will soon see Leavitt in the iconic spot behind the podium in the White House briefing room - a space that led to countless tense exchanges between members of the press and officials in Trump's first administration.Steven Cheung joined Trump's team in 2016 as his campaign spokesman, and will soon take on a top communications role in the White House.Raised by Chinese immigrant parents in California, Cheung started out as an intern under then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has also been the spokesman for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Cheung became known for his fierce, and often offensive, attacks towards Trump's opponents. He has said Joe Biden "slowly shuffles around like he has a full diaper in his pants" and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis walks like a girl who “discovered heels for the first time”.During his first administration, Trump had an unusually high turnover of communications directors - six different people. Anthony Scaramucci infamously only lasted 11 days in the role.Sergio Gor is a business partner of Trump's son, Donald Jr. He is the president and co-founder of the younger Trump's publishing company, Winning Team Publishing, which has published a book by the president-elect."Steven Cheung and Sergio Gor have been trusted advisers since my first presidential campaign in 2016, and have continued to champion America First principles," Trump said in a statement.Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.Bondi, 59, is a former Florida attorney general and long-time ally of Trump.

CONTENT: By Juana Summers, Jason Fuller, Patrick JarenwattananonMembers of the class of 2016 are presented with their degrees during the commencement ceremony at Howard University in May, 2016.The absolute number of Black men enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is the lowest it's been since 1976.That's according to recent analysis from the American Institute for Boys and Men, which crunched data from the Department of Education.In fact, Black men now currently account for only 26% of the students at HBCUs — back in 1976, that figure was 38%.All Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Calvin Hadley — assistant provost for academic partnerships and student engagement at Howard University — about what's happening, what's lost when Black men don't attend HBCUs, and how he is trying to close this gap.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Juana Summers: I want to start by talking about Howard, which, of course, is one of the foremost HBCUs in this country — a long, long list that I cannot recite of incredible alumni, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Let's start there. Are you seeing this decline among Black male students where you are?Calvin Hadley: I am. I'm a Howard alum, and so I remember as a student, the numbers were also pretty stark at that time. I think we were around 33-34% when I was a student, between 2004 and 2008. Now, as you announced in your introduction, Howard University is around 25% male total. And I think a recent statistics said around 19% Black male. And so that is felt on campus, that is felt, I think, in our social clubs, it's felt on the yard. And I think many of our male students have commented that in some of their classes, they're the only male in their class.Vice President Kamala Harris greets supporters at a campaign rally at South Carolina State University in February.Summers: So I will just say, I did not attend an HBCU. I attended a PWI — a predominantly white institution — but I have so many friends and family members who attended HBCUs. They talk to me about what that experience has meant to them, not just while they're on campus, but when they go out into their professional lives. They stay connected to the HBCU experience. They stay connected to communities like the Howard community that you represent. So I just want to ask you, when there are fewer Black men on campus, walk us through: what does that mean? What do we lose when those Black men are not as robust a presence on campuses like yours?Hadley: By the time students actually come to college, we're dealing with the males that have actually transcended what we call the “belief gap” — this gap in between what students can actually achieve and what their professors, teachers, counselors believe they can achieve. For Black males, that gap is the largest. When they get into the campus, the campus experiences are significantly impacted by the imbalance, right?At every educational institution, we want a diversity of experience. And so when you don't have as many males in the classroom, that diversity of experience is significantly impacted. It gets even more scary when we trace it forward, right? I think we're dealing with some really unique statistics right now. Black males are graduating at a much lower rate than Black females.Summers: And that's across all colleges.Hadley: Across all colleges, not just HBCUs. And so this drop in the past decade has been seen more drastically. But the reality is, this is not a Howard problem. This is not an HBCU problem. This is not a PWI problem. This is an American education problem.Summers: I want to shift gears a bit and talk about what happens when these Black men are graduating from high school and they're deciding what comes next, what that next step is. The study that we've been talking about, it notes that since 2010, as you point out, Black male enrollment has gone down across all colleges. And it also points out that HBCU enrollment has also decreased on the whole, but the decline of Black male enrollment at HBCUs outpaces those trends, if only slightly. Can you just explain to me how you understand that gap?Hadley: So I want to take a small step back. In 2013-14 we had 2990 male applicants for Howard University specifically. In 2022-23 we had 9705. A significant, significant increase.Howard University graduates arrive for the 2023 Commencement Ceremony in May, 2023.Summers: And what does that say to you?Hadley: That the Howard University education, and the HBCU education, is highly sought after, right? And there are a number of really important things that happened between 2012 and 2022 — one of those was the election of President Donald Trump, another was the murder of George Floyd. I think when those things happen in the United States of America, the HBCU experience, which had already been known to many of us, had now become a much more attractive proposition. You notice a significant increase in those male applications.What I didn't provide you was the number of female applications that accompany that. While we received 9700 male applications in 2022-23, we received upwards of 30,000 female applications. And I want to take a step aside and say Black women are ripping it up. All the statistics show, from high school to college to college graduation, that the Black women is successful today, and the trajectory is going straight up. Unfortunately, when you look at the Black male, the exact opposite is the case. And so for those Black males that are now being left out of the college equation, that also means they're being left out and stratified out of a certain portion of our society.What we now will have is an imbalance in the community that has a significant impact on our ability to create whole families, I think. On the ability for us to ensure that our generations after us have additional success, and really to have additional mobility.Summers: I want to end on this: You are a product of Howard University, as you point out. You now work for the university. And you're raising two young Black boys. What's your pitch for why a young Black man who might be hearing our conversation in 2024 should choose to attend an HBCU?Hadley: Wow. Thank you for that. You attend an HBCU for an education and not a degree, and as an assistant provost, that's not a popular thing to say. The education that you receive in an HBCU transcends the classroom experience. It transcends the relationship that you have with your professor. The education exists in between the lines of the pages. HBCUs inundate you with the sense of belief. We talked about the importance of that belief on the front end, the belief gap that exists in K through 12.HBCUs are created to instill you with the belief that you can be even larger than you can dream. Howard University and the HBCU community has provided me — and many other people, like our vice president — with the sense that I am enough. I can be successful academically. But my world is not simply academics. I can be enough and I can contribute to this society, in this space, in a way that allows me to feel whole and allows me to contribute to something much larger than myself. The HBCU community needs you. And so when I'm talking to that young man in 2024: Come because we need you. Come because you're important. Come because without you, our community is hurt.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

ith another election days away that could return Donald Trump to the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris will be making her closing arguments to voters next week at The Ellipse, an expansive, 52-acre oval lawn in Washington between the White House and the National Mall.The location is no accident. It’s where Trump encouraged his supporters to help him overturn his election loss on Jan. 6, 2021, setting off a violent storming of the Capitol. “If Mike Pence does the right thing,” Trump told the crowd he had gathered that day, “we win the election.” It was a lie. Aides had told Trump beforehand that Pence had no authority to change the result. For Harris, the echoes of the recent past on that lawn are the point. As polling shows her and Trump essentially tied in the seven battleground states, the Harris campaign believes emphasizing the former President’s admiration for dictators and vindictive talk is the right approach in the home stretch. Focus groups in those critical states have found that undecided voters are more likely to support Harris when she talks about turning the page on Trump’s dark worldview and when they are reminded of the many people who have worked closely with Trump and don’t trust him to be President again, according to a campaign aide.Recent reports of former top Trump officials describing him as fascist has helped the campaign lean into that message. Harris has increasingly used the word to describe Trump in recent days. A digital ad the Harris campaign released Thursday shows menacing black and white images of Trump as a voiceover from Harris cites his admiration for dictators and calls him, “unstable and unfit to serve.”It’s a strategy that the campaign intends to continue to tee up in the coming days and emphasize further in her speech at The Ellipse on Tuesday. Harris wants Americans to be reminded of what Trump said there on Jan. 6, and link it to the former President’s recent comments laying out his autocratic vision for the Presidency. That event will follow a high-profile rally on Friday in Houston where Beyonce is expected to perform and is intended to highlight Republican abortion bans.Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media platform that Harris’ latest critiques of him come from “her warped mind” and she’s stepped them up because she “sees that she is losing.”A recent Trump town hall hosted by Univision gave the Harris camp plenty of new fodder. Trump said he wants “extreme power” and called his opponents “dangerous people” and the “enemy from within.” He also called Jan. 6 a “day of love” in which "nothing" was "done wrong."  Given a chance on Fox News to explain those comments, Trump doubled down, saying there was “beauty” to Jan. 6 and “it’s accurate” to call fellow Americans “enemies.”The Harris campaign is also amplifying striking comments coming from Trump’s own former senior officials. John Kelly, who was Trump’s longest serving White House chief of staff and was Secretary of Homeland Security, told the New York Times that Trump “prefers the dictator approach to government” and recalled that Trump had told him “Hitler did some good things too.” Mark Milley, Trump’s former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Trump “fascist to the core,” according to a book from Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward.Read more: Former Trump Aides Warn of Secret Presidential Crisis PowersThis represents a shift for Harris. After President Joe Biden made Trump’s threat to democracy an animating force of his successful run for President in 2020, he continued that strategy as his party defended the Senate in 2022 and in the re-election bid he formally kicked off in early 2024. Some party leaders complained that Biden needed to be talking more about issues like the economy. When Biden dropped out in late July, Harris took a different tack. As she reintroduced herself to the American public, Harris initially stepped away from the gloomy predictions about a Trump autocracy and projected a forward-looking message that emphasized what she would do to reduce housing and health care costs and roll back abortion restrictions. Instead of talking about the stark danger to democracy Trump poses, Harris described herself as a former prosecutor who knew how to make a forceful case against Trump to voters. That was clear the day she took over Biden’s Wilmington campaign headquarters. Harris told gathered staff that her campaign “is not just about us versus Donald Trump.” Someone in the room shouted, “Preach!”But, now, with just over a week remaining until the polls close, Harris’ final pitch to the voters is very much about drawing that same contrast with Trump that Biden emphasized for years. That’s been driven in part by the increasing frequency of comments from Trump that is raising anxiety among many voters about what he would do if he reclaimed presidential power. But as the race has tightened, the Harris campaign also thinks that ringing those alarm bells are what will push the few remaining voters not already in a declared camp over to her side.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

f the U.S. election taught us anything, it’s that Democrats are increasingly struggling to connect with immigrant and minority voters. Contrary to their claim that immigrants who vote Republican are simply “voting against their interest,” the reality is far more complex.It’s true that immigrants generally hold more socially conservative views, but even those who don’t may feel uneasy about drastic structural changes. They left behind their homes, jobs, and lifelong friends to pursue a better future for them and their children. It was a calculated risk, a gamble they were willing to take. For many immigrants, voting for Donald Trump and the Republican Party represented a focus on issues like inflation, the economy, and education—priorities that, to many immigrant voters, seemed like the safer choice.In my view, Democrats haven’t fully grasped the idea that immigrants have conservative tendencies. The party instead relies on framing Republicans as racist or assuming immigration policy alone determines how immigrants vote. That came with disastrous consequences for them on Election Night.Voting data shows significant shifts in areas with large immigrant populations. For example, in Allentown, PA, which has one of the largest Syrian communities in the U.S. and a Hispanic population of 54.3%, the Democratic margin dropped by 18 points from 2016 to 2024. Similar patterns appeared in Lawrence, MA (80% Latino), where Democratic support fell by double digits compared to 2020, and in Starr County, TX (97% Hispanic), where Republicans won for the first time since 1896.Many Democrats were left asking: Why, despite the President-elect’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, would so many immigrants and Latinos vote Republican?The answer is that immigrants and minorities, particularly working-class ones, are unhappy with the economy and much else. Whether they are from Mexico, Honduras, or Guatemala, if they are Christian, Muslim, or Hindu, many felt the Republican’s message of self-reliance, economic opportunity, and traditional values aligned more closely with their vision of the future.That’s not to say immigrants don’t care about immigration. They do, in fact. A lot. It’s just that their views are often more nuanced than they are perceived. Take the border issue, for example. The conventional wisdom is that immigrants—particularly Latino ones—would be put off by Trump’s border bluster. But an October New York Times/Siena College poll found that 67% of U.S.-born and 51% of foreign-born Latino respondents didn’t feel that Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric was directed at them. Some immigrants also actively distance themselves from newly arrived migrants, seeking to assimilate as “true Americans.” They share concerns that unchecked immigration could stoke anti-immigrant sentiment, even if they think it won’t be directed at them, as the New York Times/Siena College poll suggests.To add to that, the U.S. immigration system is convoluted and unfair. Many are on work visas who work high-paying jobs, pay taxes, and own homes, yet still lack a path to citizenship. Thousands more are stuck in years-long asylum cases, living in limbo and knowing a single decision could force them to leave at any moment. From this perspective, it’s no surprise that many view border crossings as “cutting the line.” Most immigrant voters either know the broken system firsthand or have loved ones navigating it.Adding to these misconceptions is the tendency some Democrats have of labeling immigrants as “low-information” voters, pointing to language barriers and limited accessibility. While these barriers do exist—especially in rural areas—the truth is most immigrants make careful, informed choices. Consider my parents. My father, a former civil engineer and real estate developer, and my mother, a former OB-GYN who ran her own practice, voted for the first time this year as newly naturalized citizens in Massachusetts. Despite limited English, they spent hours studying each amendment on the ballot—a commitment shaped by their experience in Syria, where such democratic processes are absent.Both parties would do well to better understand voters like my parents. That will help them win over and speak to a growing part of the electorate. Today, one in 10 eligible U.S. voters are naturalized citizens—a 32% increase from 2012 to 2022, compared to just 8% growth among U.S.-born adults.With so much at stake, it’s time for America to know the truth. Immigrants are largely not voting based on “vibes” or “identity politics.” For them, the ballot box is a practical tool to shape their future—one they intend to use thoughtfully. Hopefully one day soon, politicians will do a better job understanding them, and speaking to their concerns.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: By Tom Bowman, Lauren HodgesJosh Abate and Micah Coomer inside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.For more reporting about Josh Abate and extremism in the military, listen to the new series 'A Good Guy' from NPR's Embedded podcast.“Have you ever tried to overthrow the U.S. government?”If you’re trying to get top secret security clearance for a government job, that’s a standard question for the required polygraph exam. And the answer, obviously, should be no.But Josh Abate couldn’t say no if he wanted to pass the test.“It depends,” he said, when he took the exam in early 2022 for an internship.The polygrapher paused and asked him to elaborate.“Well, on January 6th, I went into the Capitol building.”That was the first time Abate, a 24-year-old sergeant in the Marines, had talked openly about what he did that day.At that point, he was doing well in the Marines. He made sergeant early, got a Navy commendation medal and was selected for this coveted internship with the National Security Agency.“If you get the internship, you can basically ride that out until retirement if you wanted to,” he said. “It exponentially grows your career.”Abate has always wanted to be a Marine. “There's nothing else I wanted to do. There was no plan B,” he said. “It was Marine Corps.”Abate is tall and muscular, with short brown hair and a bit of a baby face. One of his forearms is covered in a large and colorful tattoo depicting the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It’s from Revelations 6, he says.He grew up in rural Virginia, about 30 miles west of Washington, D.C., and met his wife, Ashley, when they were both in high school taking part in Junior ROTC. Abate is the son of a former Marine who became a cop. He tells us his dad is a Republican and his mom, a nurse, is a Democrat. Abate recalls that they would often argue about politics.Josh Abate and his wife, Ashley. His tattoo depicts the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, from the Bible’s Revelations 6.But for Josh and Ashley, there was one politician for them: Donald Trump.Ashley is blond and petite, and the day NPR interviewed her, she held their infant daughter as she spoke to us.She called Trump a moral man and said they share the same values.“You know, I come from a household where religion, manners, work ethic, that kind of thing, is very important,” she said.And Josh? He said he likes the fact that Trump is supportive of a strong military.Josh said he gets most of his news from Fox and conservative websites. When asked, he said he hasn’t seen headlines like when Trump called fallen soldiers “losers” and questioned John Kelly, his former chief of staff, saying, “I don't get it. What was in it for them?" at a 2017 Memorial Day event in Arlington National Cemetery, where Kelly’s Marine son, Robert Kelly, is buried. He was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.In the months before Jan. 6, 2021, Abate was at Marine Base Quantico, about an hour south of Washington. Fox News was playing on several base TVs most of the time. The pandemic was raging. Tens of thousands of Americans had died from COVID-19 at that point and most public spaces like bars and restaurants had been shut down. Abate and his fellow Marines were stuck in the barracks, day after day, staring at screens. The Marines even canceled a training trip to Norway.Abate found that annoying.“We were just cooped up in our rooms,” he recalled. “You didn’t join the Marine Corps to stay in your bedroom and work for a couple of hours a day and play video games.”After the elections that November, the main message being spread by Fox anchors, reporters and guests was the same: Joe Biden had “stolen” a victory from President Donald Trump. Abate was buying into it.So were two of his friends, Sgt. Dodge Hellonen and Cpl. Micah Coomer. They were planning to drive out to Washington, D.C., for the now infamous “Stop the Steal” rally. And they texted Abate, asking him if he wanted to come along. He said he accepted because he wanted to listen to Trump’s speech.“I actually wanted to see him speak in person, like, the last time as sitting president,” Abate said.Then-President Donald Trump speaks during a rally near the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.The two Marines picked up Abate at his home and drove north to Washington. But he said the traffic getting into D.C. slowed them down, so they missed the speech on the Ellipse, near the White House, which ended with Trump telling the crowd that they had to fight for their country. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol,” Trump said.Abate said they all noticed a crowd heading that way and joined in, crossing the wide lawn toward the iconic building.They entered through the Senate wing doors about seven minutes after the crowd broke through. This was the first entrance to be breached that day, so Abate and his friends were among the first people to actually go into the Capitol.“We walked right in,” he said. “We didn't see any signs that, you know, said ‘do not enter’ or ‘no trespassing.’ And as soon as we walked through the door of the Capitol building, there were two police officers standing right across from the door. I figured if we weren't supposed to be there, they would have told us to get out. Nobody was trying to be, like, rambunctious.”He told us he was inside the Capitol for about an hour and saw or heard no yelling, breaking glass, or violence.Capitol Police officers inside the building on Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, D.C. Protesters stormed the historic building, breaking windows and clashing with police.But we were outside the Capitol at the exact same time and we experienced something very different — something ugly — and reported on that extensively. While getting crushed by a crowd of angry Trump supporters, we met rioters who spoke proudly into NPR microphones about plans to hang politicians from gallows before storming up the marble steps and surging through doors and windows. The overwhelming evidence is of one of the most violent and shocking days in American history.Meanwhile, Abate said he calmly and quietly strolled the halls for about an hour, helped put a MAGA hat on a statue, and then finally left with his friends when police ordered everyone out.Then he said they drove south, back toward Quantico, before joining Ashley at a restaurant called Fatty’s.While they were eating, every TV screen in the restaurant showed images of a raging mob at the Capitol, surging into the building and punching cops, smashing some with flagpoles and their own shields.“We were all just looking at it like, holy crap,” Ashley said.She said she turned to her husband, wide-eyed. “Did you see any of the stuff they’re talking about?” she said she asked him that night.He said no. But all three Marines looked at each other. “Like, we should probably not talk about this,” Abate remembered. He told us he took out his phone and started deleting all pictures and videos from the day.Photos of Dodge Dale Hellonen, Joshua Abate and Micah Coomer from their military access cards.“I knew that if word broke that Marines were in the Capitol it would reflect badly on the Marine Corps,” Abate told us. “And I knew that even though I didn’t do anything bad — I didn’t cause any violence, I didn’t perpetrate any sedition or treason and things like that — I knew that I would just be grouped into everything.”The three never talked about Jan. 6 with each other again. And before long, Coomer was transferred to another assignment at Camp Pendleton, Calif. Hellonen was off to Camp Lejeune, N.C.Over a year later, Abate passed that polygraph test — the one where he admitted being in the Capitol on Jan. 6. He was sent to a special signals intelligence school in Florida. Josh and his wife returned to the Washington, D.C., area at the end of 2023, ready to start that prized internship and set up a home with Ashley, who had just found out she was pregnant.Just two weeks before Abate was about to start his NSA job at Fort Meade in Maryland, he got a text. His sergeant wanted to meet for a cup of coffee. “Change into civilian clothes,” he told Abate, who figured the meeting was about his internship. But after passing the building where Abate was supposed to work, they pulled into the parking lot of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.“So NCIS just wants to ask you a few questions,” the sergeant told him. “Nothing to worry about. Just be truthful.”Abate said he got a sinking feeling.A half dozen agents came from both sides of the building and surrounded him, telling him he was under arrest for Jan. 6. They clasped on handcuffs and escorted him to an interrogation room.“I was like, s***, this is happening,” Abate said.They showed him pictures of himself inside the Capitol, along with Hellonen and Coomer. Then they put Abate in the back seat of a government car and drove him south to Washington, where he was booked. He spent the night in jail, sleeping on a metal bench with a bright light shining from the ceiling.What he didn’t know yet was that not all of his Marine friends were able to keep that vow of silence about being inside the Capitol.According to the FBI, just three weeks after Jan. 6, Coomer sent a private message to a friend. An FBI search warrant found that he was talking about the extremist movements present in the Capitol that day, including guys in Hawaiian shirts who often call themselves the Boogaloo Bois. Coomer said to his friend, “I’m waiting for a Boogaloo.”His friend wrote back asking, “What’s that?”Coomer simply replied: “Civil War 2.”Both Coomer and Hellonen declined our requests for comment.All three Marines were charged with the same crimes in early 2023. Federal prosecutors had them on four charges, including entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.Over the next few months, Abate was placed on administrative duty at work. And as he and Ashley waited at home for the legal case to run its course, the grim reality set in. “You think all the typical things,” she said. “Like, what are we going to do when he loses his job?”Abate and his lawyer, Dave Dischley, a family friend in Warrenton, Va., were eventually able to work out a deal with prosecutors. They were willing to drop most charges in exchange for a guilty plea on just one misdemeanor. And the recommendation was a reduced sentence of 21 days in jail.Abate appeared before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee. She was assigned to Hellonen and Coomer, as well. She declined a request for an interview.But what we know about Judge Reyes is that, going into the sentencing, she was openly stunned that a Marine would participate in the insurrection. “It’s scary to think that our active duty military were part of the insurrection,” Reyes told Abate, according to a transcript of the hearing. Reyes said she was inclined to give Abate six months behind bars.Abate told the court in a written statement that he was wrong about the election being stolen, about what Trump was telling the country. “Each of the lies circulated by President Trump were incredibly harmful to our democracy and our unity as a nation.”And then came the letters. More than 50 of them from family members, friends and fellow Marines. Judge Reyes said she read them all beforehand. Twice.One was from a Gold Star mom whose son was killed in 2011. “I have met many Marines that are truly good Marines and good people,” she wrote. “Josh is one of those Marines.”The mother of a childhood friend wrote: “Even though I’m a strong liberal, I would never consider Josh to be a threat. I truly believe he is just fundamentally good.”Not everyone was willing to write a letter. Abate said a fellow Marine told him basically, "Josh, I like you, but not what you did."But there were more than enough to sway Reyes. She went as far as telling Abate that his case had made her a “better judge.” And she gave him a sentence: 279 hours of community service — one hour she said, for each Marine casualty in the American Civil War.“She mentioned something about how she’s kind of envious of the story that I can tell my daughter and help her learn from my mistakes,” Abate told us. So this federal judge had gone from being openly disgusted with Abate for joining the violent mob at the Capitol, to essentially helping to craft a redemption story for him.“Maybe this won’t be so bad after all,” Abate remembers thinking.Earlier this year, NPR spent several hours talking with Abate and wanted to learn more about his activities that day. His description of the insurrection — that he meandered in and never really noticed that what he was doing was wrong — just didn’t make sense based on what we saw that day.We went through a few other direct questions about Abate’s actions that day.Did you chant?“No.”Of the statue he put the MAGA hat on: A statue of what? A specific person?“I don’t remember,” he said. “It was just a random statue in the Rotunda.”He really didn’t see anything disturbing or aggressive?“I think if I had seen any violence, I would have left sooner,” he said.On Feb. 21, he called us back for a second interview. When we arrived, he was holding a printout from the FBI’s official statement of facts and started reading from it.“ ‘Abate appears in the crowd and then he walks,’ ” he said. “And it talks about how he walks and walks and walks and walks and walks. And nothing in our summary of our actions is actually, you know, spooky or violent or scary. I thought it was humorous that they, in their summary of me, my time in the Capitol building, that’s all they could really sum it up to was walking.”But down at the bottom of the printout it said “Page 1 of 45.” So clearly there was a lot more to the story.Including video.A few weeks after we talked with Abate, the House Republicans started dropping some 5,000 hours of security camera footage from Jan. 6 on a public video platform, including time stamps. The security footage does not contain any audio.Credit: Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight—Republican Majority via RumbleWhat we saw was that seven minutes after the doors to the Capitol were breached, Abate walked in with Hellonen and Coomer. They slowly made their way toward the front of a crowd just 20 steps from the House chamber itself. At one point, Abate cupped his hands around his mouth, and the video shows he clearly is chanting “stop the steal” over and over. At one point, Abate is holding a yellow flag with the words “Don’t Tread on Me.” He appears to gesture to his friends to follow him to the front of the crowd toward the chamber doors. Soon, tear gas starts to fill the hallway. They make their way out of the space and back into the Capitol Rotunda.Way in the back of the Rotunda video, you can make out Abate taking a hat out of someone’s hands and trying to place it on top of a statue. He finally gets it on there by climbing onto the pedestal.It’s a bust of Martin Luther King Jr.From there, Abate and his friends became part of a large, rowdy crowd. The front of the crowd is facing off against a line of Capitol Police who are attempting to push everyone out. Abate stands firm amid the crush and scuffles happening around him, not turning around and leaving. Finally, after several minutes and jostling in the crowd around them, the three of them make their way out of the Rotunda and out of frame.The story that Abate told us — about an almost casual stroll through the Capitol — just didn’t hold up.We called his lawyer to tell him what we’d just watched and to ask to sit down with him again. Abate declined.A crowd gathers in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, D.C.Despite avoiding jail time, Abate’s career with the Marines was still on the line. In December 2023, he had a retention hearing, where a panel of his colleagues would decide whether he stayed or would be kicked out. It was held in a nondescript government building at Quantico. The hearing lasted 4½ hours.Retention hearings are administrative but structured like a courtroom. There was a Marine officer who argued in Abate’s defense, saying he was remorseful and accepted responsibility for what he did. His defense lawyer, Dave Dischley, was also there.Ashley and their baby showed up to support him. Dischley made sure to introduce them to the room.Another officer served as a kind of prosecutor. One of the points he argued is that Abate by his actions violated an agreement he signed when he joined — one that explicitly forbids participation in extremist activities. The officer said Abate should be kicked out with an other-than-honorable discharge, a red flag to all future employers.Several Marines acted as witnesses, all telling the panel that Abate is a fine Marine.“I would say that his initiative is top-notch, sir,” one said.“By far the most outstanding professional Marine I’ve ever encountered,” said another. “Gentlemen, I wouldn’t be here if someone didn’t give me a second chance. If he can pull off what I know he’s capable of, as a man, as a Marine, as a father, he will show that growth can occur, and that he can overcome even something as trivial as this.”And then something truly startling happens. The panel includes two officers and a senior sergeant. They all are asked by Abate’s defense attorney about their views on the attack on the Capitol. Are they positive, negative or indifferent?“Depending on what news source you look at, you get a different narrative, different perception," Lt. Col. Sean Foley said. "It’s a tale of two cities, and at this point, I mean, to be honest I’m tired of hearing about it three years later.”Then Master Gunnery Sgt. Steven Glew, who said, “So I wasn’t there. I can’t say I know exactly what happened there. So I’m indifferent to what happened that day.”And finally, Capt. Spencer Morris: “The video footage I’ve seen of the day, specifically focused on the more violent parts of Jan. 6, it definitely gives me a negative perception of how things transpired.”In the end, the panel unanimously decided to keep Abate in the Marine Corps. Separate panels for Hellonen and Coomer did the same. But Coomer was kicked out shortly after his hearing by a general at Camp Pendleton; Hellonen ran out his enlistment — his contract with the Marines was up — and he left the Corps.Glew, who had said he was indifferent to what happened that day, was the only one of the panelists who agreed to talk with us about why he voted to retain Abate.“I have just seen a lot of him in me,” Glew said. “And then, you know, just seeing his family there, his baby, just made me think, you know about my family and what they would have been going through if I was in Josh’s position.”Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro will be the one who makes the final decision about Abate’s fate in the Marines. Ten months later, he has yet to make the call.Digging into Abate’s story and the aftermath of Jan. 6, we learned that Abate was by far not the only Marine — active or retired — who went into the Capitol that day. Some one-third of the 200 active and retired military participants arrested for their role in the Capitol attack were Marines. That’s a disproportionate number, considering the Marines are the smallest of the fighting forces.“It is shocking when somebody that’s taken an oath to protect the country is doing something to harm it,” said Michael Jensen, who researches domestic terrorism at the University of Maryland. He said the Marines have one of the highest rates of extremist activity going back more than three decades.“The Army is the largest branch, so you’d expect for it to have the highest numbers,” he said. “But the second highest number comes from the Marine Corps. They are having an outsized impact driving these numbers of cases, yet they are doing the fewest investigations.”The Jan. 6 attack forced the Pentagon to come up with a definition of prohibited extremist activity. That definition came out at the end of 2021, and it basically says service members can’t get involved in any activities that call for political violence, passing out literature or raising money for extremist groups, liking something on social media, even wearing clothing or having bumper stickers that promote extremist causes.Each of the services this year put out guidelines and said they would start collecting data on any extremist activities in the ranks. Right now, the military has yet to start collecting data that was called for in the recently released guidelines, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials say they think the numbers are small. Still, some say that even a small number of extremists can have an outsized effect on the military force.We have spent the last six months trying to get officials to talk about the new guidelines, and most have refused. But just a few weeks ago, we were able to ask the Marines' top officer, Gen. Eric Smith, this question: Do the Marines have an extremism problem?He said a minuscule percentage of Marines engage in inappropriate behavior.“What I don’t want to do is hit a fly with a sledgehammer,” he said, “and accuse all Marines of doing something untoward because that’s just not the case.”But what about the lopsided number of Marines who took part in the Capitol attack?“No, I don’t worry about that. I think what you see is an anomaly. Those individuals who participated in the Jan. 6 events, those weren’t Marines. They were individuals masquerading as Marines. Our culture didn’t bind to them.”We’d heard the word “anomaly” before. In Abate’s retention hearing from his defense lawyer Dave Dischley. “The odds that another event like January 6th is going to occur in this country, you know, in the next hundred years in this country, I think is very slim,” Dischley said. “I think we can all agree to that. The odds that Sergeant Abate would be a part of that? Less than a fraction of a percent.”Tear gas drifts over the crowd outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.But an Associated Press investigation found that nearly 100 people were killed or injured since 2017 in plots that included U.S. military or veterans, most of them in service of a far-right agenda.In mid-October — just weeks before the 2024 election — Trump was asked about the Capitol attack at a Univision town hall. His answer was defensive and laced with inaccuracies. He also called it “a day of love.”As for Abate, he wasn’t ruling out another vote for Trump in 2024.“I still like Trump,” he said. “There's no bad taste in my mouth about Trump.” But, he said, he was still deciding.We called Josh Abate back one more time as we wrapped up reporting, to ask again if he still liked Trump. But through his lawyer, he declined to speak with us again. He was done telling his story.A previous version of this story incorrectly said U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes sentenced Joshua Abate to 279 hours of community service for each American killed in the American Civil War. It should have read that Abate was sentenced to 279 hours of community service for each Marine casualty in that war. Also a previous version of this story incorrectly said 200 participants were arrested for their role in the Capitol attack. It should have said 200 active and retired military participants were arrested.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: In 2016, Michele McInroy was overjoyed to pick up the keys to her new home - a two-bedroom flat in a refurbished building in Woolwich, south London. But her joy soon soured.Communal areas were neglected, lifts didn’t work and repairs went unfixed, Michele says. Earlier this year, her service charge increased to around £10,000 a year, marking a 320% rise in five years.Michele, who works as a civil servant, hopes to move from the capital to Dundee to be closer to her grandson but she is struggling to sell the flat - and believes that the service charge is making it harder still. “I'm losing time that I could be spending with my family that's really precious to me,” she says.“I just feel trapped and there is absolutely nothing I can do.”Across England and Wales, other homeowners are telling similar stories, as annual service charges have risen significantly. The average is currently £2,321, up 44% since 2016, according to estate agent Hamptons. In London it’s £2,500, marking a 52% increase in the same period.Others I have spoken to say their service charges have increased by 400-500% in that time.Among them is Gaz Rahman, whose annual service charge for his flat in the London borough of Tower Hamlets hit £4,654 in 2024, up from £960 five years earlier. “There's no accountability,” he argues. “It just doesn't add up.”Sue Robertson, who owns a one-bedroom flat in West Sussex, reports that her service charge has shot up by 320% since 2019 - from £750 to £3,198 a year.Some leaseholders have opened up about the devastating effect of these costs on their lives - among them are cases of bankruptcy, pressure on relationships and mental health. Sue Robertson tells me that she was hospitalised after attempting suicide. The financial pressure was, she says, a major factor. “Everything just got too much for me.”For years, politicians have said they planned to address this issue. Then, last week, the current government committed to abolishing leasehold. Housing minister Matthew Pennycook said in a statement that there will be a consultation and white paper early next year - but for some this has come too late.And the question that remains is, how did it reach a point where the government needed to intervene?Part of the problem is that this is an archaic system, based on principles dating back to the feudal days of landowners and tenants. Under the current system, leaseholders have to pay charges to a freeholder for services, including the maintenance and repair of communal areas and buildings insurance. Often a managing agent is appointed by the freeholder.The vague language in the current law adds to the confusion. The law simply states that service charges must be “reasonable” and that where costs relate to work or services, they must be of a “reasonable” standard.But campaigners in the field argue that there is another issue at play. They claim unscrupulous freeholders and managing agents are exploiting the system.As Sebastian O’Kelly, chief executive of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, puts it: investors cottoned on to the fact they could make money out of the boom in newbuild apartment blocks that have sprung up across the country over the last 25 years.Previously most freeholders were local authorities or landowners but the boom has led to investors - including venture capital, pension funds and even charities - getting involved. Income from ground rents and lease extensions as well as the rising value of the land itself all make this lucrative.“We're talking about a multi-billion pound property sector.” He argues that leaseholders are at the mercy of companies who are “just there to make money out of them”.In a recent investigation, the BBC examined about 140 tribunals relating to one London-based firm, Assethold, and discovered that judges have assessed it to have overcharged homeowners by a combined sum of nearly £1.2m. Assethold said it was "actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions" and had implemented changes where necessary.But the BBC has seen complaints about other companies accused of overcharging leaseholders too. The problem with policing this is that anyone can buy a freehold and anyone can set themselves up as a managing agent.“There are still thousands of people being exploited,” says Sir Peter Bottomley, former Father of the House of Commons and a campaigner against the leasehold system. “The stories that have come to me in my last 15, 20 years in Parliament would make most people weep.” He says that these include numerous stories of leaseholders being exploited by freeholders.“And it's been happening in broad daylight.”He also argues that it is “often the young and less well-off who are being lumbered with costs they cannot afford, in ways which are unjustified”.The Residential Freehold Association (RFA), which represents the largest freeholders in the country, strongly disagrees that the system is “exploitative”, but says it has “called for improvements to the home buying and selling process” so that leaseholders understand their obligations.Large newbuild estates and buildings can be complex and expensive to maintain, but a concern among some is the lack of transparency. Leaseholders have complained about hefty bills with little detail or unexplained demands for eye-wateringly high sums.The Leasehold Advisory Service says that of the 33,000 people have gone to them for advice in the past five years, it has received more complaints about service charges than any other subject.However, industry insiders argue that there are legitimate reasons for rising charges, including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the fallout from Brexit.“We have seen significant inflation in recent years, as well as extensive material cost increases following the Covid pandemic. This ultimately translates into higher service charges,” the RFA said in a statement.Jaclyn Mangaroo of the Property Institute, a professional body that represents managing agents in England and Wales, is among those arguing that Brexit triggered an increase in costs. Some say exiting the EU has led to labour shortages in the industry.Mrs Mangaroo also points out that the Grenfell fire tragedy has seen insurance charges rise, which in turn pushed up service charges.However her organisation wants managing agents to be regulated to prevent what she calls “abuse” of the system. Its members are properly trained, she stresses, “but there is no oversight or accountability for those outside the membership, for everybody else that's operating”.Last week the housing minister has announced they would regulate managing agents but added they need to consult on this first.Abolishing leasehold for flats was not included in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024. Ultimately, the Conservative government ran out of time to get everything it wanted into the legislation before Rishi Sunak called the general election.The legislation that passed did include some gains for leaseholders, such as giving them more power to buy their freehold. Now, however, certain elements of the previous government’s plans that never made into law will be taken forward by Labour, including making it easier for residents to acquire “the right to manage”. (In other words, they will still have a freeholder but can take over the management of their building.)However, the RFA says its studies show that “self-management looks to make no difference” to service charge costs.After Scotland abolished leasehold two decades ago, it introduced the commonhold system where residents own the building and a factor (a type of property agent) maintains the common areas of buildings on their behalf. Unlike managing agents in England, factors must be registered.Commonhold has been an option in England and Wales since it was introduced under Tony Blair’s government in 2002, but the tenure has not caught on - it applies in only 1% of properties in England and Wales.Then, last week, Pennycook announced that commonhold would be made "the default tenure," as part of the wider plan to abolish leasehold, but this will all take time to get right. The prime minister reiterated this in a radio interview.Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), believes that commonhold is the right way forward. “[It means] the flat owners all have a vested interest in getting best value for money on service charges.”But the RFA warns that commonhold isn’t a “silver bullet”. Sometimes, not all residents in a building agree to work going ahead, which can slow down repairs or prevent them happening at all, they say.Whatever happens next, it won’t be easy. Landowners have power and deep pockets and they’re prepared to fight for the land. A group of major freeholders are bringing a legal challenge under the Human Rights Act over proposed changes to the calculation used to compensate landowners when leases are extended.Henry Hill of the ConservativeHome website is sceptical that any government will ever be able to successfully take on all those with a vested interest in preserving leasehold. “We're talking tens of billions, hundreds of billions maybe worth of value, unless the government was prepared to try and just take that without compensation, which in our current legal regime would be impossible,” he says.“Formally abolishing leasehold is not going to happen.“However, Sebastian O’Kelly is hopeful. “Labour needs to get it finished,” he says.Labour has said it will indeed get it finished and it is “switching on” some of the legislation that the Conservatives bought in. In addition, they are drafting another bill that will go further.In the meantime, however, frustration is still growing among many leaseholders, as this all requires more waiting.And according to Suzanne Muna from the Social Housing Action Campaign (SHAC), “people are getting organised”, with members going on service charge strike and refusing to pay soaring bills. It is a risky move, as under lease conditions, it can leave leaseholders at risk of losing their home.Some, however, have successfully challenged their service charges. Property lawyer Keeley Livingstone, from Essex, says she was able to save £140,000 for her and her neighbours, after spending more than 100 hours examining their bills and pointing to the freeholder where they had been overcharged.“There were a few things on there that just didn't look right,” she says. “We have a concierge and security. I questioned that because [the bill] was so high, and we don't see half of these people. That was removed - £98,000 worth.”But others, like Michele, still feel stuck. “I have absolutely no power,” she says. “I want to sell my flat and I cannot.”She says that Pennycook, who is her local MP, seemed sympathetic to her situation when she and her neighbours raised it with him. Whether he can change their particular situation - and that of thousands of others - remains to be seen.“I would never buy a leasehold again,” says Michele. “Landlords have too much power. The management company has too much power. It should be equal, and it's not.”Additional reporting by Lauren StanleyBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

CONTENT: Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says.The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation.The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week.However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough.Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy.Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought "no sense of relief" for him."I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now," said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities.The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks.Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector.The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it.Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill "a dog's breakfast" and vowed to introduce "deeper cuts" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May.The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill "dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause".The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked "tough" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years.The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place.The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed.But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure."The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution," Mr Sheehy said."We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps."How Australia cricket is still affected - and will continue to be so - by the death of Phillip Hughes 10 years ago.Australia's 295-run defeat by India in the first Test "hurts", says captain Pat Cummins.Drake's Australian tour kicks off the same day rival Kendrick Lamar will headline the Super Bowl.India travel to Australia for their five-Test series - here's everything you need to know, including the schedule, squads and how to follow on the BBC.England are no longer in contention but which sides can still qualify for the World Test Championship - and what do they need to make it?

CONTENT: By Scott Detrow, Kathryn Fink, Ashley Brown, Tyler BartlamPastor Chad Harvey says he doesn't think his church is getting more political, but that politics is getting more spiritual.On a late October evening in North Carolina's capital city, a massive stage in a dark auditorium is backlit by tall screens, and bass-thumping music and vocals are filling the space.There's a table of judges in front of the stage. Think American Idol but with a clearly religious focus. It's worship team audition night at Cross Assembly Church inside the congregation's nearly 1,700-seat sanctuary on a sprawling, multi-wing campus that resembles a high school or community college.This Pentecostal church is led by pastor Chad Harvey, whose sermons — often to weekly crowds of about 3,000 — usually feature on Cross Assembly's social media channels. Harvey says only a small part of his job intersects with politics, but there’s no way to completely avoid political discourse.“If I thought the fate of history depended on the 2024 election, I'd be as anxious as you and popping as many pills you are. Fortunately, I don't believe that stuff,” he said in a sermon posted to social media over the summer. “My hope is in Jesus, not in the politics.”These days, Evangelical and Pentecostal conservatives are a powerful force in Republican politics. And they have stuck by former President Donald Trump for three presidential elections in a row. In fact, in the closing weeks of a tight race in North Carolina, Trump has been appealing directly to religious conservatives.In North Carolina, All Things Considered host Scott Detrow sat down with Harvey and talked about all of this — Trump, religion, politics in general — in a small side prayer room on Cross Assembly's campus.Harvey says there is a misconception that his congregation talks about politics a lot.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Scott Detrow: How much does politics come up in day-to-day conversation when you're talking to people here, when you're talking to people in the congregation, when you're doing your pastoral work?Chad Harvey: You know, it's very interesting. I think an outsider looking into the Evangelical Pentecostal movement would assume that politics plays a huge role in the life of the church. It actually doesn't. I'd say 1-2% of my conversations are about politics. I think a lot of people are just trying to make ends meet. They're trying to live their lives.Now, I've told our folks this, you know, our church is accused of being a little bit too political, and I said: “You know, the church is not getting more political, politics is getting more spiritual.” And so we're seeing this infiltration into the political realm of things that used to be the church's territory: family, human sexuality. Now politics is starting to tackle those spiritual issues.Detrow: How do you think about which candidates you are going to support? Is it through the lens of the issues they support? Is it through how they come across as individuals?Harvey: What I've told our congregation is we look at the platform, not the person. And so you can have some people with some pretty deep moral struggles who are upholding a platform that we support. And I tell our people, don't pay as much attention to the struggles — pay attention to the platform. Because here's what the Bible says: There's none righteous. No, not one. We're all messed-up people. So whether it be some of the accusations that have been lodged at (North Carolina Lieutenant Governor) Mark Robinson recently, whether it be Kamala Harris and Willie Brown, Donald Trump telling Howard Stern the sexual revolution of the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam” — they're all messed-up people. And so that's the one thing we have to keep in mind as a congregation.Detrow: Let me just ask the direct question about this with Trump. Donald Trump has such a high support from so many Christians around the country, and yet is somebody who lives in a gold tower with his name on it, who crudely insults people and, among other things, is facing criminal charges. And some people just feel like this is not the message, as I understand it, of Christianity, but there's such a strong support. What's the best way you explain it to someone who says, I just don't understand that?Worship team auditions at Cross Assembly Church.Harvey: So I would say, again, I keep going back to we're all messed up people. Trump is messed up. Kamala Harris is messed up. Joe Biden has had accusations thrown at him. We're all messed-up individuals. And so I think what I keep coming back to is a lot of people seem to think that we're having a continuous, 24/7 Trump rally in the Evangelical Pentecostal circle. We're actually not. We're well aware of his foibles. We're well aware of where he's messed up. I think the reason Trump is resonating with Evangelicals is this mess aside that we all know about, the platform he's supporting, like it or not, is closer aligned to our view of scripture than the other side.Detrow: Does that create a world, though, where there's never any accountability for anybody personally?Harvey: I do think that at some point, there will be a line that's crossed. And so at that point, what I said is, sure, that's fine. Let's just make sure we're using that standard across the board. So, “This candidate did this. I can't support him.” That's fine. Don't support him. The only thing I'm asking is to use that same standard.Detrow: You mentioned the lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. I want to ask about that because I think one of the first things that drew us was that he's spoken to Cross Assembly in the past, and you've gotten to know him a little bit.Harvey: Yeah. Yeah.Detrow: What do you make of him as a candidate and as a man?Harvey: You know, as a man, very winsome. I think one thing that drew him to a lot of individuals in our congregation is we have somebody in high political office who's talking our language. I've said many times about Mark Robinson, for every strength is a corresponding weakness. His strength is he's not part of the political system. The weakness is sometimes he talks like a man who's not part of the political system, and maybe he phrases things that make people uncomfortable. But as an individual, I really feel like the values that he espoused from the pulpit really resonated with our biblical worldviews.Detrow: What I'm hearing is that line hasn't been crossed yet.Harvey: Yeah. ...He did speak at our church, and I think some people see that and say, well, do you view him as a spiritual leader? Well, no, I don't. He's still a political candidate.Detrow: I think we've talked about this in pieces here and there, but I want to give you a chance just to directly talk about it in one swoop. What do you think more secular listeners, listeners of other religious persuasions, listeners who live in other parts of the country — what do you think it is they misunderstand the most about congregations like yours?Harvey: Wow. That's a great question. I would say, again, kind of putting my ear to the ground and seeing what's being said about the Evangelical Pentecostal voting bloc, I think one of the biggest misperceptions is that this is what is dominating our mind. This is what's really driving us. I keep hearing this term, Christian nationalism. That's been the big buzzword in 2024. I've not heard of that until this year that we're just trying to impose our Christian beliefs on this nation and make us a Christian nation. That may be true for other congregations. I don't know that that's true for a large segment of Evangelical Pentecostal Christians.You know, the Bible says, make it your goal to live a peaceful and quiet life. I think a lot of us just want to have a peaceful and quiet life, be able to share the good news of Jesus Christ. I don't think we're driven by this desire to make America a Christian nation, and I don't think politics really occupies as big a part of our brain as people think it does.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: H
ang on a minute. Whom did we just elect? The Republican ticket had two names at the top: Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. But parts of this delirious November created the impression that someone else has taken hold of our collective destiny.We already knew him in various roles—the guy who bought Twitter and fired more than half its staff, the inventor who brought the space program back to life, the carmaker whose new trucks make kids stop and stare on the sidewalk. All of a sudden, Elon Musk had moved into the realm of politics, headlining rallies, steering government appointments, shaping the agenda for the next President of the United States.For more than three years he’s been one of the world’s richest and most powerful men. Markets soar and tumble on his tweets. Astronauts fly in his spaceships. Armies advance with the signals from his satellites. Conspiracy theories go mainstream through his embrace. But it was only in the spotlight of these elections that the full extent of his influence came into view.Not since the age of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate who greased FDR’s ascent nearly a century ago, has a private citizen loomed so large over so many facets of American life at once, pulling the nation’s culture, its media, its economy, and now its politics into the force field of his will. Standing beside him, even Trump can seem almost in awe, less of a boss than a companion to the man for whom this planet and its challenges are not big enough.Click here to order your copy of this issue of TIMEFor now they act like partners, bonded through the favors they are trading and their shared desire to disrupt the institutions of government. They may deliver commands with one voice for a while. But their agendas do not align on everything. Both are willful, impulsive, and accustomed to being in charge. What will happen if they start to clash?In that kind of fight, Musk may not have the upper hand. History is strewn with the wreckage of kingmakers who went to war against the leaders they installed. No matter how much wealth or influence Musk collects, the tools of state power will remain with the President, and things will get messy if he decides to use them against the billionaire who helped him return to the White House.
In the end, the durability of their partnership may depend on Musk’s motives: What drove him to become a MAGA prophet in the first place? If it was money he wanted, then mission accomplished.The value of his fortune surged by more than $50 billion in the week after the election, peaking at more than $320 billion, as investors went berserk for shares of Tesla. But wealth has never been Musk’s obsession. The way he has bet his fortune on moony passion projects, like putting a greenhouse on Mars, should be proof enough that he dreams differently than the average ­Klingon aboard Starship Trump.Read more: Why Elon Musk Was Person of the Year for 2021People close to Musk say his ultimate goal has not changed since he launched SpaceX, his rocket company, in 2002. (Among its investors are Marc and Lynne Benioff, the owners of TIME.) For more than two decades, Musk’s white whale has been the red planet. It’s written right there on his favorite T-shirt: OCCUPY MARS. “Everything goes to that mission,” says a member of Musk’s social circle who recently talked to him about his plans. “He’s just realizing that being in control, directly or indirectly, of U.S. government budgets, is going to put us on Mars in his lifetime. Doing it privately would be slower.”That does not mean U.S. taxpayers would foot the bill for Musk’s dream of interplanetary travel. But the public does tend to pay a price when eccentric visionaries take the reins of government. Millions of Americans, from retired factory workers to debt-laden graduates and newborn children, benefit from the social programs that Musk has promised to slash. Though he fires off multiple tweets a day to his 205 million followers, Musk has declined to answer questions from reporters, including this one, since he became consigliere to the President-elect. He has not explained his reported contacts with American adversaries, from China and Russia to Iran. Nor has he addressed the conflicts of interest that arise from playing a key role in a government whose regulators investigate his businesses.So far, Trump seems happy to play along. In the middle of his victory speech on Nov. 6, he spent four minutes praising Musk, the “super genius” who helped run his ground game in ­Pennsylvania, reportedly paying canvassers to knock on 11 million doors and hiring vans to bring Amish people to the polls. “We have a new star,” Trump crowed from the stage in Florida. “A star is born—Elon!” Only later, roughly 19 minutes into his speech, did the President-elect turn back to his teleprompter and remember to thank his voters.What Musk meant to the Trump campaign went far beyond the $120 million he pumped in, the field program he established, or the social-media boost he provided. To many of the young men who flocked to Trump in record numbers, Musk was an ideal avatar. He injected a sense of ingenuity and possibility into a familiar nostalgia act. If Trump thrills supporters by pledging to destroy corrupt institutions, Musk represents the promise of building new things and solving hard problems. Trump did not seem so old at his rallies with this Diablo-playing edgelord bouncing around beside him. And it became harder for Trump’s opponents to paint his team as a gaggle of halfwits when the greatest innovator of our time, with a record of delivering on outlandish plans, was pledging to slash spending by $2 trillion.No matter how often the Democrats reminded us that Trump’s fortune grew out of inherited wealth, multiple bankruptcies, and decades of corporate shenanigans, they could not deny Musk’s achievements as a businessman. Even Senator Bernie Sanders, scourge of the billionaire class, hedged his criticism in a recent podcast: “Elon Musk is a very, very aggressive and capable businessperson, very impressive with what he’s accomplished. He says, I could do more in a week than the government can do in, you know, five years, and in some ways he’s right.”At a time when faith in government has cratered, that’s all many voters want to see—a capable outsider, ruthless and independent, who knows how to take a gargantuan machine and make it leaner, faster, and more productive. Musk’s promise to do that with the American bureaucracy has already created momentum and cover for cutting costs on a scale that Washington has not seen in many years. That agenda did not get far during Trump’s first presidential term. Millions of people depend on government jobs, and on the protections that regulators provide from predatory businesses, like those that gave us opioid abuse and cigarettes as a cure for asthma. But small-government Republicans will be eager to follow Musk into ugly budget battles over federal waste and bloated entitlements. Many Americans will be rooting for them.On the campaign trail, the most convincing argument Musk offered was not on Joe Rogan’s show or onstage at Trump’s rallies. It was on the launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas, where Musk’s aerospace company dazzled the world by catching a returning rocket with a pair of robotic arms. If the man who did this supports Trump with such fervor, couldn’t Trump accomplish even some of what he promised?Read more: What Elon Musk Really BelievesA lot of voters seem to think so, especially the young men Musk targeted for Trump with his bravado. “The biggest factor here is that men need to vote,” Musk told Rogan on the eve of the election. The next day, when 60% of white men turned out for Trump, Musk tweeted: “The cavalry has arrived.” But his appeal reached well beyond the manosphere. It also moved a swath of voters who were put off by Trump’s character but excited by his policies. TV pundits said these people needed a “permission structure”; Musk provided just that to suburban women like Betsy Stecz. As she stood in line for his October rally in Lancaster, Pa., Stecz described a sense of relief: “You have people finally feeling like, OK, I can hold my head up and say: I’m not ashamed to vote for Donald Trump.” The reason, in her view, was Musk.Given his role in the victory, Musk may have expected some reward. But his perch in Trump’s transition has reportedly ­unnerved some members of their entourage. For much of November, Musk camped out at Mar-a-Lago, weighing in on Cabinet picks and advising Trump on policy priorities. He went golfing with the President-elect, sat ringside with him at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event and took pictures with the Trump family; one grandkid raved on social media that Musk had attained “uncle status.” Musk coined a different term for his position: “First Buddy.”Even that was an understatement. The leaders of Turkey and Ukraine had Musk listening in on their calls with Trump. An envoy from Iran, which stands accused of trying to assassinate Trump, reportedly met with Musk to talk about defusing tensions. (Iran’s Foreign Ministry has denied the meeting.) When House Republicans invited Trump to a closed-door session on Capitol Hill, Musk tagged along, the window of his car in Trump’s motorcade labeled GUEST 1.Read more: Iran, Trump, and the Third Assassination PlotBy that point, Trump had appointed him to lead a new entity called the Department of Government Efficiency. Its acronym, DOGE, was a nod to the canine-themed ­cryptocurrency Musk has promoted as a kind of joke. But its mandate was serious. Trump claimed it would “dismantle” the federal bureaucracy and “restructure” its agencies. “This will send shock waves through the system,” Musk said.It could also give Musk influence over the many agencies that regulate his work. A few weeks before Election Day, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced it is investigating Tesla’s self-driving vehicles after reported crashes. In June, regulators in California ordered Tesla to “correct ongoing air quality violations” at its Fremont plant. Tesla has said its cars are safe and its facilities comply with environmental standards. SpaceX has also had run-ins with the Federal Aviation Administration, which Musk threatened to sue for overreach in September. A review by the New York Times found that his companies are facing at least 20 regulatory battles and investigations from “all corners of the government.” Musk and multiple representatives declined to comment or to respond to TIME’s questions for this article, including about potential conflicts of interest.He has yet to explain what principles would guide his purge of the bureaucracy. The co-­director of DOGE, Vivek Ramaswamy, ran on a pro-­business, libertarian platform in the last Republican primary. Musk’s politics, by comparison, are harder to pin down. This summer he referred to himself as “historically, a moderate Democrat.” He has called climate change the defining challenge of our age. When Barack Obama ran for President in 2008, Musk stood in line for six hours to shake his hand.His relationship with Trump has often been rocky. Their views on tariffs are far apart, and Musk lasted less than six months as an adviser to the White House in 2017 before quitting in protest over Trump’s climate policies. Five years later, Musk said it was time for Trump to “sail into the sunset,” eliciting a furious response. “Elon should focus on getting himself out of the Twitter mess,” Trump said, “because he could owe $44 billion for something that’s perhaps worthless.”Trump had a point. Musk’s purchase of Twitter made little evident business sense. He paid at least double the company’s value in 2022, then spent weeks dynamiting its revenue streams and cashiering its talent. The company’s head count, he has said, fell from 8,000 to around 1,500 under his leadership. Some of his posts on the platform, which he rebranded as X, came off as spasms of corporate self-harm. One referred to an antisemitic theory as the “actual truth.” (He later apologized.) Another shared a conspiracy theory about the hammer attack that put House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in the hospital with a fractured skull. Dozens of companies, including Microsoft and Coca-Cola, pulled their ads from the platform in response. “Don’t advertise,” he told them last fall from the stage of a conference. “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f-ck yourself. Go. F-ck. Yourself. Is that clear?” The investment firm Fidelity assessed in October that X had lost nearly 80% of its value in the past two years.Musk didn’t seem to care. Even without most of its workforce, the platform continued to function, routinely topping the list of the most-downloaded news apps in the Apple app store. Major advertisers have returned. For some observers, all this has been reason enough to applaud Musk’s takeover as a master class in corporate efficiency. “What Elon did with Twitter is he got inside, cleaned house, and now it’s working better than before,” says the member of Musk’s social circle. “So the mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government.”That’s a tall order. Even fiscal hawks have balked at Musk’s promise to eliminate $2 trillion in ­federal spending. It would require taking an axe to Medicare, ­Social Security, and other parts of the social safety net. Musk warned the nation to prepare for a period of “temporary hardship” as these cuts take effect. But it’s far from clear that he will even have the power to make them. DOGE will remain outside of government, with no authority to fire federal employees. Many budgetary experts expect it to go the same way as countless blue-ribbon panels that tried and failed to pressure politicians to cut the programs their constituents love. In identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, the U.S. Congress needs no help: it already has an oversight branch called the Government Accountability Office, which assiduously tries to do that job.Many early fans of DOGE say they recognize the limits of its potential and celebrate it all the same. “Yes, a Department of Government Efficiency is probably a pipe dream and might end up as essential as Monty Python’s Department of Silly Walks,” the Wall Street Journal columnist Andy Kessler wrote on Nov. 17. “But even if Mr. Musk’s DOGE simply trims some bloat and saves a few hundred billion, it will be worth it.”On the campaign trail, Musk talked a lot about the need for the U.S. to live “honestly” and “within its means.” But if his social-media platform is any guide, his aims may have less to do with efficiency than ideology. His stated goal in acquiring Twitter matches one of his favorite reasons for supporting Trump: he says he wants to salvage free speech in America. “Freedom of speech is the bedrock of democracy,” he told Joe Rogan on the eve of the election. “Once you lose freedom of speech, you lose democracy. Game over. That’s why I bought Twitter.” Multiple reports and studies concluded that under his stewardship the platform has become a refuge for hateful and harmful content, in part because he fired its content-moderation team.Read more: Elon Musk and the Tech Bro Obsession With ‘Free Speech’Asked to explain his shift to the right, Musk often brings up the “woke mind virus,” his term for the leftward shift in American society that, in his view, gave rise to identity politics, cancel culture, and supposedly rampant online ­censorship. His grudge against these forces is not merely political. During the pandemic, one of his children sought gender-affirming medical care, and Musk has said he was tricked into approving it. His transgender daughter, who is now 20 years old and estranged from her father, legally changed her name in 2022 to Vivian Jenna Wilson. On a podcast in July, Musk said his child “is dead, killed by the woke mind virus. I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.”Wilson posted her response the next day: “I look pretty good for a dead bitch.” On Nov. 5, as the results of the election became clear, Wilson published another message: “Blame the f-cking politicians and oligarchs who caused this to happen,” she wrote. “Direct your anger towards them.”In ancient Greek, the word oligarkhia meant “rule by the few.” Its earliest critic was Aristotle; in the 4th century BCE, the philosopher described it as a state of affairs in which “men of property have the government in their hands.” In medieval Venice, the leader of the oligarchy ruled for life, and he went by the same title that Musk gave to his new department: the Doge.The purest expression of this system in modern times took shape in Russia in the 1990s, when a few businessmen bought up control of the national economy during its chaotic transition to capitalism. The Russian term for their oligarchy is ­semibankirshchina—the reign of the seven bankers.The most powerful among them, Boris Berezovsky, used his media assets to help Putin win his first election in 2000, and he expected the new President to share the spoils of power. Instead, the two of them began to feud. Soon the Russian state forced Berezovsky into exile and seized his television network. Broke and lonely, the oligarch died in 2013 at his mansion in the ­English ­countryside. Authorities ruled it a suicide. To this day, his former media channel carries the Kremlin’s message.
One of Berezovsky’s close associates, Alex Goldfarb, now lives in New Jersey, and he has followed the tandem of Musk and Trump with a mix of familiarity and dread. “There seems to be an oligarchy forming here as well,” he says. “Under Putin in the early years, we had the oligarchs fighting the state with everything they had,” says Goldfarb. “Here it seems we have two oligarchs, Musk and Trump, working together to take over the state.”The outcome may depend on the way this new duopoly treats the institutions they will soon control. If the aim is to sharpen them into leaner and more effective tools of governance, the public could benefit from the remaking of a system that has long been weighed down with bureaucratic flab. But Trump has also used those tools the way Putin has done in Russia—to benefit his friends and sideline his enemies.Musk has a lot to gain from that arrangement. As long as he sticks to the role of First Buddy, he might expect an easy ride from the regulators Trump appoints throughout the government. His clearest path to Mars could thus run straight through the Oval Office. But apart from ­watching the spectacle of his success, what benefit will trickle down to everyday Americans?The institutions that give us health care, keep our water clean, and educate our kids are not meant to be run like businesses. They are not built to make a profit, but that does not make them any less valuable, especially for the citizens who can least afford to pay. If those institutions get culled amid the Muskian push for efficiency, the hardship will not be temporary for those who rely on government support. For them, the pain could be devastating, and none of Musk’s promises of an interplanetary future will help them get through the problems of today.—With reporting by Eric ­Cortellessa/Lancaster and Leslie ­Dickstein/New YorkCONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: A warning from Representative Ritchie Torres of New YorkSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsIn the days after the election, Representative Ritchie Torres, who represents a district in the Bronx, piled onto the complaints about his party. He argued they are too responsive to the “far left” and have “managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos.” They were spouting “ivory-towered nonsense” that the working class wasn’t buying. As a series of tweets, the theory is superficial. Kamala Harris—and even Joe Biden—have not been especially beholden to the far left, either in their policies or in their presentation. Harris did not lean into her identity nearly as much as, say, Hillary Clinton did in her campaign. And Bidenomics was aimed at the working and middle class.But Torres’s conviction, it turns out, comes from a deeper place. Torres is 36, Afro Latino, and represents a district that is more than 50 percent Latino and working class to poor. He grew up poor himself and did not graduate from college. It’s by now a very old stereotype, he says, to assume that Latinos are pro-immigration. In his experience, the perception of New York being overrun by undocumented immigrants is a preoccupation among his constituents, and ignoring their worries about this issue, and the state of the economy, is what he believes caused urban neighborhoods to shift rightward.In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we hash out the “Democrats are too woke” theory and talk about Torres’s ideas of how the Democrats should change their approach to immigration.The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin: Donald Trump lost New York, like everyone thought he would. So that’s not news. What is, though, is how much better he did in the city than last time. Manhattan moved to the right by five points, Brooklyn by six, Queens, where I grew up, by 11—11 points! As my Trump-voting brother bragged to me: “It was a shellacking.”I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. New York, Miami, Chicago, Philly, Dallas, Detroit all shifted right. Trump’s message seemed to especially land in urban, working-class neighborhoods, where immigrants and people of color live.Now, there are lots of reasons the country shifted rightward, and we’ll probably be talking about them for a while. But these are neighborhoods that have voted reliably Democratic. So the shift is noticeable and surprising, although not to this person.Ritchie Torres: For me, the far left is a gift to Donald Trump. And it will be the gift that will keep on giving until there’s a serious reckoning with the results of the election.Rosin: This is Congressman Ritchie Torres. He represents a district in the Bronx, which, by the way, shifted right by 11 points. He, like many people, has a theory for why Trump won.The day after the election, he tweeted: “Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like ‘Defund the Police’ or ‘From the River to the Sea’ or ‘Latinx.’ … The working class is not buying the ivory-towered nonsense that the far left is selling.”Now, this is not an original take. Lots of people last week were screaming at the Democrats some version of “woke is broke”—that’s how Maureen Dowd put it, at least. But Torres has some authority on the subject that other people lack: He’s young—36. He’s Afro Latino. He’s gay. He grew up poor. And he didn’t finish college.He’s also a proud Democrat representing a district that’s over 50 percent Latino. To him, what happened seems pretty obvious.Torres: You know, the main reason we lost was inflation and immigration. And on the subject of immigration, I do believe we swung the pendulum too far to the left.Rosin: When I think of Kamala Harris, I don’t necessarily think far left. I mean, she talked about being a prosecutor. She was measured on her Israel-Gaza positions. Her position on the border got more moderate. So far left does not necessarily, to me, describe what happened in the last election.Torres: I am not suggesting that Kamala Harris is far left. So take as an example, “defund the police.” It was never the case that the majority of the Democratic Party endorsed “defund the police,” but the far left has an outsized microphone and, therefore, has an outsized impact in defining the image of the Democratic Party in the public mind.Rosin: And you don’t think that’s because the far left is exaggerated by the right? I mean, that the right has a megaphone making it seem like the far left is the Democratic Party when neither Kamala Harris nor Joe Biden are especially far left or advocate far-left policies?Torres: Can you make that argument with respect to immigration?Rosin: Yeah, immigration is an exception. You’re right about that. I mean, I was thinking about—Torres: It’s the exception that cost us the election.Rosin: Yeah. I was thinking about working-class policies because if I think about actual policies—because you talk a lot about policies versus messaging—Torres: We have prosecutors in America who have swung the pendulum too far to the left and have been rejected by voters in blue states.Rosin: Mm-hmm.Torres: So we can blame the voters. We can claim that the voters are misogynist and white supremacist. We could blame Fox News and the New York Post. But those institutions have always been with us in recent political history.Rosin: Although never as mobilized as they are now. I mean, there is a concerted effort to make the Democrats seem like its most extreme version, and that effort is well funded, well coordinated, and very effective.Torres: I’ll take an example of the issue of Israel, right? I’m known to be strongly pro-Israel.Rosin: Right.Torres: There’s not a Republican in the country that could caricature me as anti- Israel because I make it crystal clear where I stand. And rule No. 1 in politics is: If you do not define clearly what you stand for, others will define it for you. And I often feel like the image of the party is defined not by the center left, which is the heart of the party, but either by the far right, in the form of the New York Post and Fox News, or the far left.Rosin: So where do you stand? What would you say publicly and loudly about where the Democratic Party should be?Torres: The Democratic Party should stop pandering to a far left that is far more representative of Twitter and TikTok than it is of the real world. And it should start listening to working-class people of color. And we have to take positions that are aligned with the priorities of working-class people of color.Look—take the issue of immigration. I’m strongly pro-immigration. For me, the more the merrier. I see immigration as the driver of entrepreneurial and the essential workforce of America. But I’m also self-aware enough to know that I’m considerably to the left of the country. And you have to meet people where they are.You cannot impose your ideology on the majority of the American people. You know, as elected officials, we are constrained by public opinion.Rosin: This rightward drift we now know in New York happened in Washington Heights, the West Bronx, Queens, which is where I grew up. It’s working-class communities of color. So how do you explain that? Is it all immigration? What is that?Torres: Look—for me, what was most troubling was not only the fact that Donald Trump won but how he won. Not only did he crack the blue wall in the industrial Midwest, but he’s beginning to crack the blue wall in urban America. You know, he came within five points of winning New Jersey.Rosin: Right.Torres: He came within 12 points of winning New York. He won nearly 30 percent of the vote in the Bronx, which is one of the most Democratic and Latino counties in America. And keep in mind that the trends that we are seeing unfold long predate the 2024 election. Donald Trump made inroads among voters of color, particularly Latinos, in the 2020 election. And he decisively built on those gains in the 2024 election, but he did not begin those gains in the 2024 election.Rosin: So you think it’s police and immigration?Torres: The main reason is inflation and immigration and public safety. But on the subject of inflation, we were a victim of circumstances—like, supply-chain disruptions during COVID led to high inflation. And when you’re the incumbent party in power, you’re blamed for what happens, fairly or unfairly. And to be blamed for inflation is a political death sentence. So that, to me, is not the fault of the party. Inflation is a global phenomenon with global causes. But immigration is different. I do feel there was political malpractice that led to our loss of credibility on the issue of immigration.You know, since 2022, there has been an unprecedented wave of migration, whose impact was felt not only at the border but in cities like New York, where the shelter system and the social safety net and municipal finances were completely overwhelmed. You know, in December of 2023, Quinnipiac reported that 85 percent of New Yorkers were concerned about the impact of the migrant crisis on New York City.Despite clear signs of popular discontent, the Biden administration waited two and a half years before issuing an executive order regulating migration at the border. And by then it was too late. The political damage had been done. The Republicans had successfully weaponized the issue against us.Rosin: Okay. This is helpful. Your critiques come across on Twitter as broad critiques, the sort of general, broad critique that we don’t speak to the working class. And there are parts of that that don’t totally make sense to me, but I think you’re narrowing that to a couple of specific and important issues.Torres: Well, I think if you—first, it’s Twitter, so I’m constrained by the limits of tweets. But I would recommend that you read all the commentary I’ve made, not simply one tweet that gained more than 3 million views. The first tweet I sent out was about just the complicated electoral environment that we were entering.Vice President Harris was at a structural disadvantage in an antiestablishment atmosphere. The majority of Americans disapproved of the Biden administration. The majority of Americans feel that America is on the wrong track or heading in the wrong direction. And the majority of Americans feel that they are worse off today than they were four years ago.That is an insurmountable challenge, no matter who’s the nominee, right? It’s about structural reality rather than individual personality. Now, we thought that Donald Trump was so radioactive that we could overcome that structural challenge, and we were wrong.Rosin: Did you think that, by the way? Did you also think that? Like, were you surprised?Torres: I’m shocked but not surprised. Like, I find Donald Trump’s victory to be shocking but not surprising, because, in recent electoral history, there is no precedent for an incumbent party winning a presidential election when more than 70 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track or headed in the wrong direction. And so in the end, it is not surprising that Trump fatigue was outweighed by the popular discontent over inflation and immigration.Rosin: After the break, I ask Torres how he thinks Democrats can rebuild after this loss.[Break]Rosin: Okay. So let’s turn to rebuilding. It seems genuinely difficult in 2024 to compile a Democratic Party that’s working-class voters plus urban, college-educated, mostly white liberals. Do you have any ideas or thoughts about how to stick those two coalitions together?Torres: I would look to New York as a success. I mean, New York was a profound disappointment in 2022. You know, Lee Zeldin was masterful at weaponizing the words of the far left against the Democratic Party, causing congressional losses in 2022. But in 2024, we had a resounding success.We took back nearly all the congressional seats that we had lost. We ran on the strength of strong candidates like Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi and Josh Riley and Pat Ryan. And the common thread among all of them is that every one of them is a centrist or center-left Democrat. So for me, the lesson learned there is that the road to 270 electoral votes and the road to the congressional majority runs through center left, not the far left.Rosin: And can you say what center left sounds like? What is a center-left Democrat talking about? Are they talking about specific constituent issues? What does it look like to be responsive?Torres: Economically populist, right? We have to convey the sense that we’re fighting for working people and that we’re holding powerful interests accountable, right? And I think that’s where the left is onto something, right? I think what we should avoid are the excesses on issues like immigration or public safety, right?There should be nothing resembling “defund the police,” nothing resembling open borders. People do care about border security. People do care about public safety. We have to ensure that we’re on the center of those issues while doubling down on economic populism.Rosin: So weirdly, on a national level, like an Elizabeth Warren-ish message, it sounds like what you’re talking about. So when I think of real solutions to working-class problems, I think of breaking up monopolies, real strong consumer protections. But those are big-government policies, and big-government policies are not that popular. That approach doesn’t seem to really gain traction, even though it seems like the right policy solution.Torres: So much of politics is rhetorical, and I just feel like we have to give people the sense that we are fighting for them, right? And too often, people have the impression that we’re obsessed with a culture war. But I want to be clear: I continue to believe the main reasons we lost the election were inflation and immigration. And I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ critique. I do not think President Biden abandoned the working class. Legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act is meant to support working people. It’s meant to support America, but the benefits of the legislation in the short term are outweighed by the cost of inflation.Rosin: So can you say how you would talk about immigration or address immigration? Because for people who are not looking too closely, it feels a little counterintuitive that, you know, a majority say—Latino or people-of-color districts and voting class—their main issue is restrictions on immigration. It seems, on its face, to be a contradiction. Now, I’m sure when you get deeper, it isn’t.Torres: If you’re stereotyping Latinos, sure.Rosin: Yeah, exactly. So let’s get beneath the stereotype, and, like, how would you walk through that issue?Torres: Well, I mean, keep in mind that the most Latino county in America was Starr County, right at the border. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won it by 60 percentage points. And in 2024, Donald Trump won nearly 60 percent—a complete collapse of Latino support. Look—my view is that we do not have a messaging problem; we have a reality problem.When the migrant crisis was unfolding, we should have responded with the sense of urgency that the public demanded of us. The public saw it as a crisis. So it’s not a messaging problem. It’s a reality problem. When there is a crisis, when there’s an emergency, when there’s a metaphorical fire, we have to extinguish the fire. We have to do everything we can to extinguish the fire, or else we’re going to pay a price at the ballot box.Rosin: Although, it still surprises me that people would drift towards a leader who uses words like “mass deportation,” you know, or the whole “floating island of garbage” thing. Like, it still surprises me that that’s not an automatic “no.”Torres: Again, I’m appalled by it, but I’m self-aware enough to recognize that I’m considerably to the left of the rest of the country in immigration. And here’s the danger: If we swing the pendulum too far to the left on issues like immigration and public safety, we will risk a public reaction that will make our country more right wing, not less; more restrictionist on immigration, not less; more conservative on public safety, not less.Rosin: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. So how do you—Torres: I just want to illustrate this point further: Before the “defund the police” movement, Republicans were becoming more open to criminal-justice reform, right? Hakeem Jeffries, who’s going to be, eventually, the speaker of the House, negotiated a bipartisan criminal-justice-reform legislation. And then after the “defund the police” movement, any hope of bipartisanship on criminal justice has all but collapsed.Rosin: I see. So this is what you mean. You’re saying, The Democrats are allowing—or, by capitulating to some far-left language, are allowing—the Republicans to use the language against us. Like, they’re handing them a tool.Okay. I understand what you’re saying. Just as a model, can you just tell me how you talk to your constituents about immigration? So we know what your own personal feelings are. We know that you’re listening to what they’re saying. What’s the kind of language that the Democrats could have adopted and should adopt in the future about a touchy issue like immigration?Torres: I’m not clear the issue is language. I mean, I’m happy to answer the question, but I—Rosin: What kind of policies? Sorry. Yes, you’re right. What kind of policies?Torres: I mean, basic border security.Rosin: Just talk about that. Yeah.Torres: Like, so you cannot have a system where anyone anywhere can cross the border, declare asylum, and then remain here indefinitely.Rosin: Right.Torres: And there was a point at which the sheer number of people coming became overwhelming. Like, it put unprecedented strain on the shelter system and social safety net of New York City. And, you know, I know Mayor Adams came under severe criticism for excoriating the administration. But for me, the problem was not Mayor Adams complaining about the migrant crisis; the problem was the reality of the migrant crisis and the administration’s failure to address it with the urgency that the public demanded.Look—I feel if we return to the center left on both immigration and public safety, I’m cautiously optimistic that communities of color will naturally gravitate toward the Democratic Party as its natural home. That’s my belief.Rosin: Right.Torres: We have to meet people where they are, or there’s a limit to how far we can deviate from strongly held public sentiment on an issue like immigration.Rosin: Last thing I want to say is: Disinformation seems overwhelming—like, just overwhelming in a very, very coordinated way. How do you combat something like that? Like, no matter what you will say on immigration, there’ll be a disinformation campaign to skew it, turn it, whatever.Torres: Look—we do our best to speak out against disinformation, but I’m probably in the minority here. I’m not convinced we lost because of disinformation.Like, if you remove inflation and immigration from the table, we win the election. We win the election because Donald Trump’s net favorability has been chronically underwater. He is unpopular among most Americans, but he was seen as a change agent, as an alternative to a status quo marked by inflation and the migrant crisis. If you change the status quo, he no longer wins the election. That’s my belief.Rosin: Okay. All right. This has been really, really helpful. I really appreciate this.

CONTENT: Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club Mar-a-Lago is once again the Winter White House - the place to be seen for West Wing hopefuls as the US president-elect assembles a new administration behind its opulent doors.While President Joe Biden will remain in office until January, this part of Florida has become a rival centre of political power in America.Just two years after an FBI raid found classified documents about US nuclear weapons and spy satellites stored in a bathroom, an eclectic mix of insiders are swarming to Mar-a-Lago, which is patrolled by robot dogs and armed guards on boats.North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, rumoured as a potential energy secretary, was there on election night. So was former US Defence Department chief of staff Kash Patel.Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has been alongside Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago during family dinners and calls with world leaders.Musk has been photographed inside the private club with his son and on the runway of Palm Beach International Airport, as he shuttles back and forth to be by the president-elect’s side.For those not blessed with an invitation to stay at Mar-a-Lago itself, the hotels and restaurants around nearby West Palm Beach are packed with office-seekers jostling for influence in the new administration and supporters celebrating Trump’s victory.Robert F Kennedy Jr, vaccine sceptic and scion of the one of the most famous US political dynasties, was by the swanky pool bar of The Ben hotel, where a fake ice rink and Christmas tree greet guests.Giant, golden Great Dane dog sculptures adorn the lobby and every floor outside the lifts.He is part of the transition team and the one-time presidential candidate is vying for a role with influence over health policy.Speaking even before the election, alongside the former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat-turned-Republican, he said: “There’s people of all different kinds of ideology and people that we’re going to have to go up against in that transition team and fight for our vision.”Also spotted at The Ben was outspoken Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who recently blamed the Biden administration for causing flooding in Republican areas of North Carolina. She is believed to be jockeying for a cabinet position.At The Breakers, an opulent Italian Renaissance-style oceanfront hotel, the young valets were most star struck by the visit of Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who joined his friend Trump on stage on election night, but who says he has no personal political aspirations.The same cannot be said for others. One GOP insider that the BBC ran into in the corridors said the transition was “a free for all”, as different factions of the party battle for dominance.“Trump loves to see people scramble and suck up.”But the insider noted with a hint of worry that some “minimally acceptable people are starting to say they don’t want a role”.Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, for one, has conveyed that he isn’t interested in working in the administration and would prefer a Senate leadership position.Donald Trump is expected to focus less on elected officials to fill senior positions.His son, Don Jr, said during an interview on Fox News that he wants people who “don’t think they know better” than his father and that he’s prepared to block anyone he thinks would be a disaster.The president-elect has been vocal about doing things differently this time around, feeling his biggest mistake during his first presidency was hiring “bad people, or disloyal people”.Back in 2016, plans for the transition that had been prepared by former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in concert with the outgoing Obama administration were laid to waste.Once the Trump team won what was seen as an improbable victory, they decided on an unconventional approach and fired Christie.What ensued was an Apprentice-style parade of people to Trump Tower in New York that played out in front of the cameras.Back then, news crews packed into the lobby to capture everyone headed up the golden elevator to see Donald Trump on the 26th floor.While the world was still trying to understand what a Trump presidency would look like, those with influence in Wall Street, media, politics and entertainment all sought an audience, including Bill Gates, Al Gore and even Kanye West.This time around, Trump seems to be prioritising loyalty, tallying up who has been with him since day one.And the world’s media are crammed onto hotel balconies and the parks and beaches surrounding Mar-a-Lago, where security is at fortress levels.The transition process is still unconventional by design, but so far it is far more behind the scenes than in 2016.Trump’s first appointment - Florida political consultant Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff - does offer one clue that a well-built Florida conservative political operation could be ready to replicate its success in the White House.Slater Bayliss, co-founder of a Florida-based lobbying firm, Advocacy Partners, has worked both for and against Ms Wiles during election battles in the state and much prefers to be on her side.“I would say, borrowing a nickname from our friends across the pond, Susie is the Iron Lady of American electoral politics.”He says offers have been flooding in from talent across the state, which has served as a “stronghold of resistance for smart conservative thinkers who love our country and desire to play a role in making it more reflective of our electorate”.Republican political consultant Max Goodman says there is anticipation of a Florida wave crashing into Washington.He expects Trump’s team will be mining staffers in Susie Wiles’s team and in the state, whose congressional and Senate delegations came out early for Trump.“There is no hotter political farm system in the country than the state of Florida, when you have a president and the most prolific political consultant turned chief of staff calling Florida home,” he said.Despite having the second largest Republican congressional delegation in the country, Mr Goodman says Florida has “notoriously been snubbed” when it comes to having a seat at the leadership table.He believes that could change with Ms Wiles leading the charge, and with key Floridians such as Rick Scott potentially in line as Senate Majority leader and Senator Marco Rubio in contention for a high-profile cabinet position.One person who has thrown his hand up to work in the transition is Joe Gruters, who is waiting to see how that shapes up.He was the 2016 co-chairman of Trump’s Florida campaign with Ms Wiles, then the chairman of the Republican state party, and is now a state senator.Mr Gruters describes himself as a “loyal foot soldier”, who was the only member of the Florida legislature to immediately endorse Trump’s 2024 bid and appear at Mar-a-Lago for his announcement.He is counting on Ms Wiles taking her “battle-tested” lieutenants up with her to Washington to fill out positions.“They know who the true believers are… and they probably have a clear idea of who they’re going to put in most of these positions,” Mr Gruters said.Palm Beach didn’t exactly roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump when he first arrived on the scene with his purchase of Mar-a-Lago in the 1980s.But walking around town now, it’s obvious that this is firmly Maga country – Trump-branded bikinis and hats are a common sight.Next week, Argentina’s President Javier Milei is expected to visit Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump and Elon Musk.Also next week, CPAC, or the Conservative Political Action Conference, is hosting its annual investors summit at Mar-a-Lago with tickets costing up to $25,000 (£19,350).And it’s unlikely the migration south will stop once Donald Trump is inaugurated and occupies the Oval Office once more.Slater Bayliss - the Florida lobbyist - thinks Trump will want to spend as much time in Florida as possible during his second term.That will go some way, he said, in “making the 62,500 square feet of Mar-a -Lago the most sacred real-estate in the political universe”.With additional reporting by Pratiksha GhildialAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Much of the campaigning has felt like an elaborate traveling circus. But the spectacle is coming to an end.This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.How do you transform something so big, so existential, into something people can grasp? Last night, Oprah Winfrey gave it a shot as the penultimate speaker at Kamala Harris’s grand-finale rally in Philadelphia: “If we don’t show up tomorrow, it is entirely possible that we will not have the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again.”Every presidential election is the biggest ever, but this one lacks an adequate superlative. Throughout 2024, both parties have leaned on the imagery and messaging of our Founding Fathers. The Donald Trump acolyte and former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy frequently says that we’re living in a “1776 moment.” Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s democratic governor, last night invoked Benjamin Franklin’s warning about our still-young country: “a republic, if you can keep it.” It’s an oft-repeated line, but that “if” lingered in a way I’d never felt before.Shapiro was peering out at the tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder along Benjamin Franklin Parkway at the chilly election-eve gathering. Many attendees had been there for hours, and more than a few had grown visibly restless. Each emotion, both on the stage and in the crowd, was turned up to 11—fear, hope, promise, peril. At the lectern, Shapiro’s inflection mirrored that of former President Barack Obama. So much of Harris’s campaign send-off had the feel of Obama’s 2008 celebration in Chicago’s Grant Park. Will.i.am came ready with a song (a sequel to his Obama ’08 anthem, “Yes We Can”) titled—what else?—“Yes She Can.”Around 11:30 p.m., Harris finally appeared at the base of the Rocky Steps to make her final pitch. Beyond the symbolic proximity to the Constitution Center, the Liberty Bell, and Independence Hall, this particular setting was a visual metaphor for, as Harris put it, those who “start as the underdog and climb to victory.” (Sadly, no one in the A/V booth thought to blast the Rocky horns as she walked up.) The truth is, it’s a bit of a stretch to call Harris the underdog. She is, after all, the quasi-incumbent, and polls suggest that the race is tied. Still, you sort of knew what she was getting at with the Rocky thing.For the past nine years, the whole political world, and much of American life, has revolved around Donald Trump. He is an inescapable force, a fiery orange sun that promises to keep you safe, happy, and warm but, in the end, will burn you. Harris is running on preserving freedom and democracy, but she’s really just running against Trump. In surveys and interviews, many Americans say that they, too, are voting against Trump rather than for Harris. The election is about the future of America, but in a real sense, it’s about fear of one person.Harris had already been in Scranton, Allentown, and Pittsburgh yesterday. But now her campaign had reached its finish line, in Philadelphia, and though I heard cautious optimism, none of the Harris campaign staffers I spoke with last night dared offer any sort of prediction. The closest I got was that some believe they’ll have enough internal data to know which states are actually in their column by late tonight, and that they expect the race might be called tomorrow morning or afternoon.Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, wrapped up in an expectedly apocalyptic and campy manner. The truth is, some of his chaos worked—he never lost our attention. Consider the weeklong national conversation about the word garbage. A comedian’s stupid joke deeming Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean” might end up being a determining factor in a Trump defeat, but President Joe Biden’s comment likening Trump supporters to garbage also proved a pivotal moment for the MAGA movement. In response to Biden, Trump appeared in a bright-orange safety vest as a way of owning the insult—a billionaire showing solidarity with the working class. In a similar late-campaign moment, Trump donned an apron and served fries at a (closed) McDonald’s. It wasn’t the work wear so much as the contrast that told the story: In both instances, Trump kept his shirt and tie on. These theatrical juxtapositions, however inane, have a way of sticking in your brain.But not everyone gets the reality-TV component of his act. Many of his supporters take his every utterance as gospel. At Trump’s final rallies, some showed up in their own safety vests or plastic trash bags. Trump’s movement had quite literally entered its garbage phase. In his closing argument last night, Trump’s running mate, J. D. Vance, called Harris “trash.” And Trump, days after miming oral sex onstage, kept the grossness going, mouthing that House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi is a “bitch.”Trump’s campaign was much longer than Harris’s, and for that reason, I spoke with far more Republicans than Democrats at campaign events this year. Across different cities and states, it was clear that people stood for hours at Trump rallies because they still obsess over Trump the man, and because Trumpism has become something like a religion. Trump makes a significant portion of the country feel good, either by stoking their resentments or simply making them believe he hears their concerns. In the end, though, he’s also the one feeding their fears.It can be easy to write off American politics as a stadium-size spectacle that’s grown only cringier and uglier over the past decade. But last night, in my conversations with Philadelphians who’d braved the chill to see Harris, it became clear that the show was just the show, and that they had other priorities. Sure, they’d get to see Ricky Martin perform “Livin’ La Vida Loca” and hear Lady Gaga sing “God Bless America,” but all of that was extra. A trio of 20-year-old Temple University students—two of whom wore Brat-green kamala beanies, one of whom wore a camo harris walz trucker hat—told me about their hometowns. One had come from nearby Bucks County, which he’d watched grow Trumpy over his teen years. Another was from the Jersey Shore and said she believed that people would egg her house if she put a harris sign in the front yard. Another, who was from Texas, summed up the risks posed by Trump more succinctly than almost anyone I’ve spoken with over the past two years of covering the campaign: “He’ll let people get away with promoting hate and violence in our country, and I think that is my biggest fear.”This election has been an elaborate traveling circus, with performers playing into all manner of dreams and nightmares. Trump has long relied on the allure of the show, and the preponderance of celebrity cameos at Harris’s recent rallies proves that she, too, understands the importance of star power. But now that all of the swing states have been barnstormed, and the billions of dollars have been spent, what’s left? The pageantry has entered its final hours. Tomorrow (or the next day … or the next day), a new iteration of American life begins. We won’t be watching it; we’ll be living it.Related:Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:Today’s NewsEvening ReadThe Right’s New KingmakerBy Ali BrelandCharlie Kirk took his seat underneath a tent that said prove me wrong.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.There is no single explanation for Donald Trump’s unambiguous win. But if, as we were constantly told, this was in fact the most important election of our lives, in which the future of democracy really was at stake, Democrats never conducted themselves that way.It was an egregious mistake—not just in retrospect but in real time—to allow Joe Biden to renege on his implicit promise to be a one-term president, and to indulge his vain refusal to clear the way for younger and more charismatic leaders to rise up and meet the magnitude of the political moment. Perhaps no candidate, not even one blessed with the talents of a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama, could have overcome the handicap imposed on Kamala Harris when she emerged valiantly from the wreckage of the Weekend at Bernie’s campaign this summer, which her own administration had so brazenly tried to sneak past the voting public.But other major mistakes were made over the past four years. The Biden presidency was understood to be a return to normalcy and competence after the terrible upheavals of the early months of COVID and the circus of the first Trump administration. That was the deal Americans thought had been accepted—that was Biden’s mandate. Instead, as president, even as he leaned into plenty of policies that served all Americans, Biden either could not or would not forcefully distance himself from the Democratic Party’s need for performative “wokeness”—the in-group messaging used by hyper-online and overeducated progressives that consistently alienates much of the rest of the nation.Read: Why Biden’s team thinks Harris lostHere’s one narrow but meaningful example: On day one—January 20, 2021—the Biden administration released an “Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.” The order said that “children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.” Supporters argued that the order was simply pledging that the administration would enforce previously established legal protections for LGBTQ people, but critics saw it differently. As the author Abigail Shrier wrote on Twitter: “Biden unilaterally eviscerates women’s sports. Any educational institution that receives federal funding must admit biologically-male athletes to women’s teams, women’s scholarships, etc. A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls.”In signaling their commitment to an extreme and debatable idea of trans rights, Democrats hemorrhaged other constituencies. Many Americans of all races care about girls’ sports and scholarships, and they believe that protecting women’s rights and flourishing doesn’t begin and end at safeguarding their access to an abortion.Out of this larger context, Harris entered the final stretch of the campaign already compromised. Republicans seized on her previous comments in support of progressive proposals such as defunding the police (which she later renounced). But it was more than culture-war flash points. Fair or not, many Americans didn’t believe Harris deserved to be vice president in the first place. This is in large part the fault of her boss, who stated up front before selecting her that he would prefer a vice president “who was of color and/or a different gender.” It was a slightly less blunt version of what he said before appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson—that the job was only ever available to a Black woman. Harris’s very presence within the Biden administration therefore, to many onlookers, amounted to a kind of glaring evidence of precisely the kind of DEI hiring practices they intended to repudiate on Tuesday.Voters’ response was definitive. According to a New York Times analysis, “Of the counties with nearly complete results, more than 90 percent shifted in favor of former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 presidential election.” That is to say, Trump improved with every single racial group across the country except one. He performed slightly better with Black voters overall (13 percent voted for him this time, according to exit polls, compared with 12 percent in 2020), and significantly better with everyone else—particularly Latinos, 46 percent of whom gave him their vote. He received an outright majority of ballots from voters marking the “other” box—a first for Republicans—and his party reclaimed the Senate and looks poised to hold on to the House. All told, the only racial group among whom Trump lost any support at all turned out to be white people, whose support for him dropped by a percentage point.Were Trump not such a singularly polarizing, unlikable, and authoritarian figure, one of the most salient and—when glimpsed from a certain angle—even optimistic takeaways from this election would be the improbable multiracial and working-class coalition he managed to assemble. This is what Democrats (as well as independents and conservatives who oppose Trump) must reckon with if they are ever going to counter the all-inclusive nihilism and recklessness of the new MAGA majority. Much attention has been paid to the gender gap in voting, and it’s true that more men voted for Trump than women. But the fact that so many citizens of all geographies and skin tones wanted to see Democrats pay a price, not just for policy differences but also for the party’s yearslong indulgence of so many deeply unpopular academic and activist perspectives, must be taken seriously.Read: Why Democrats are losing the culture war“The losses among Latinos is nothing short of catastrophic for the party,” Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronx told The New York Times. Torres, an Afro Latino Democrat, won a third term on Tuesday. He criticized the Democrats for being beholden to “a college-educated far left that is in danger of causing us to fall out of touch with working-class voters.”Yet I fear that far too many elite Democrats will direct their ire and scrutiny outward, and dismiss the returns as the result of sexism and racism alone. In an Election Night monologue on MSNBC, the anchor Joy Reid expressed this mentality perfectly. Anyone who knows America, she said, “cannot have believed that it would be easy to elect a woman president, let alone a woman of color.” Her panel of white colleagues nodded solemnly. “This really was an historic, flawlessly run campaign,” Reid continued. “Queen Latifah never endorses anyone—she came out and endorsed! She had every prominent celebrity voice. She had the Swifties; she had the Beyhive. You could not have run a better campaign.”Over on X, Nikole Hannah-Jones, the creator of The New York Times Magazine’s “1619 Project,” wrote that we “must not delude ourselves”: “Since this nation’s inception large swaths of white Americans—including white women—have claimed a belief in democracy while actually enforcing a white ethnocracy.”Moments after North Carolina was called for Trump, Reid diagnosed what went wrong for Harris: White women, she said, didn’t come through; it was “the second opportunity that white women in this country have to change the way that they interact with the patriarchy,” and they had failed the test again. On X, commentators immediately jumped on the blame-white-women bandwagon, as if it was an evergreen obituary they all had on file, ready to post within a moment’s notice.Reflexive responses like these exemplify the binary framing of culture and politics in the United States—white/nonwhite, racist/anti-racist—that ascended with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and peaked after the racial reckoning of 2020. For many on the left, it has proved a powerful and compelling means of contextualizing enduring legacies of inequality and discrimination that are rooted in past oppressions. And it has notched real successes, especially by forcing the country to confront bias in the criminal-justice system and policing. But it has also become a casualty of its own discursive dominance—an intellectual and rhetorical straitjacket that prohibits even incisive thinkers from dealing with the ever-evolving complexity of contemporary American society. As a result, it has taught far too many highly compensated pundits, administrators, scholars, and activists that they never have to look inward.Ronald Brownstein: An uncertain future beat an unacceptable presentBut the framing didn’t work for many other people. “I’m thankful that victimhood didn’t win as a strategy,” one of my oldest and closest friends, a Black man who doesn’t have a college degree, messaged me after Trump’s victory. (It is worth noting that his twin brother, a veteran, turned MAGA during the racial reckoning.) If we are to listen to what enormous numbers of our compatriots—including unprecedented numbers of newly minted nonwhite GOP voters—are trying to tell us, the straitjacket proved decisive in their shift rightward.All of us who reject the vision of America that Trumpism is offering are going to have to do something grander than merely counter a vulgar celebrity demagogue who commands a potent populist movement. It is too late for that anyway. We are going to have to reimagine the inner workings of the multiethnic society we already inhabit. The stale politics of identity that tries to reduce even the glaringly inconvenient fact of Trump’s multiracial alliance to “white women” stands in the way of overcoming the real democratic crisis.Harris herself knows this. When Trump attempted to goad her, mockingly pondering whether she was even Black at all, she shrewdly avoided appealing to superficial categories. In this crucial way, her campaign may be viewed as an unequivocal success, one that we can learn from.More StoriesIs Wokeness One Big Power Grab?When Heterodoxy Goes Too Far

CONTENT: Donald Trump made his biggest gains in diverse areas that have supported Democrats for decades. Why?“For all his apparent divisiveness,” wrote the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, “Trump assembled the most diverse Republican presidential coalition in history and rode political trends that will prove significant for decades to come.” That statement neatly describes Donald Trump’s sweeping electoral victory this week. But Ruffini wrote it more than a year ago.Even though Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he dramatically improved his performance that year among Black and, especially, Latino voters compared with 2016. According to Ruffini’s 2023 book, Party of the People, this was no fluke. American politics was undergoing a fundamental reordering in which the old dividing lines of race and wealth were being supplanted by new ones, namely education and trust in institutions. The ties that once bound low-income and nonwhite voters to the Democratic Party, he argued, were breaking. “If this trend continues,” Ruffini wrote, “it would mean the birth of a new party system, replacing the old twentieth-century class divide between the parties.”Then came 2024. We don’t yet have precise data on how different groups voted, but the geographic swings make certain conclusions unavoidable. Trump made gains everywhere on Tuesday, but the places where he improved the most compared with 2020 were heavily nonwhite counties that have overwhelmingly supported Democrats for decades. Miami-Dade County, which is majority-Hispanic, voted for the Republican candidate for the first time since 1988; Baldwin County, Georgia, which is 42 percent Black, went red too. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried the 97 percent–Latino Starr County, Texas, by 60 points. In 2024, Trump won it by 16 points.In Ruffini’s view, the Democratic Party can no longer take the votes of nonwhite Americans for granted. “I think if they want to win back some of these voters,” he told me, “Democrats need to stop presenting themselves solely as the defenders of American institutions and instead as a party committed to change.”This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Rogé Karma: On Election Day, you wrote on X that “the FDR coalition is being dismantled piece by piece and being reassembled in Donald Trump’s GOP.” That’s a pretty provocative statement. So tell me what you were actually seeing in the data on Tuesday that made you think that was happening.Patrick Ruffini: I often cringe a little bit when this is described primarily in terms of a “racial realignment.” In many ways, it’s a racial de-alignment, because the parties are realigning on educational lines.If you look at a place like South Texas, which is very heavily Hispanic, Democrats were winning by 50, 60 points in 2012. And now we are at a point where it’s not just trending red but objectively red. You look at a place like Miami-Dade County, Florida, obviously home to a lot of Hispanics—Trump won it by 11 points.But I think the more interesting county to me was Osceola County, outside of Orlando, a heavily Puerto Rican community. There was obviously a lot of focus on Puerto Rican voters in the closing days of the campaign because of the joke told at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. But Trump actually wins that county, which is unheard of. And if you believe the exit polls, then there’s evidence that this is happening with Black voters and Asian voters as well.So when I use the term FDR coalition, I’m referring to a lot of groups that have a lot of disparate interests. To me, that has been the character of the Democratic Party for decades. You have groups who are not necessarily ideologically aligned on everything but can all find a home in this big tent. And you’re seeing that more and more in the Republican Party now. Since 2016, educated white voters have shifted left but every other group has shifted right. That was only enough for a near win for Trump in 2020, but this time it was enough for a popular majority in the country.Karma: The data here are still preliminary, but let’s say you’re right and we are indeed experiencing this racial depolarization. I think the big question is why. One way of viewing it, as you do, is as a continuation of this broader educational realignment in our politics. But another way of looking at it is we’re in the midst of a global anti-incumbent backlash. Ruling parties in countries all over the world are losing left and right, mostly driven by what you once described to me as a “post-COVID inflationary malaise.”Rogé Karma: Age isn’t Biden’s only problemRuffini: I think you’re completely right. Absolutely this was an election about the economy. Absolutely it was a change election. But underlying it is a divide in the electorate that has been building for a while now.I’m not even sure I’d describe it as strictly educational sorting. What happened in 2020—and I think what we’ll continue to see in 2024—is an ideological sorting. Lots of nonwhite voters identify ideologically as conservatives but historically have tended to vote for Democrats anyway. That started to change in 2020. You had data suggesting that Hispanic conservatives, Asian American conservatives, Black conservatives moved by about 35 to 40 points toward Trump. I think that tells us that politics is sorting on an ideological axis.And I think the reason that’s happening is because the forces that have long kept certain racial and racial-identity groups within the Democratic fold are no longer binding them to the Democratic Party. I think you have large numbers of folks in these groups who are temperamentally not on board with what they perceive to be the race-and-gender identity politics of the left. And that’s very problematic, potentially, for Democrats.Karma: This is one of the big themes of your book: Democrats have alienated working-class voters of color by moving far too far to the left on issues around race and gender identity. But it seems to me that Democrats really learned their lesson from 2020. Kamala Harris ran way to the right on immigration. She talked about the importance of having a strong military. She played up her background as a prosecutor. She hardly mentioned race. And yet we saw even bigger shifts than we did in 2020. How do you explain that?Ruffini: Harris ran a very clinically competent campaign. Speaking as a Republican, I was pretty concerned that she was going to successfully erase the taint associated with the Biden policies. I think it was clear she was trying to pivot the party in a more moderate direction on these issues.But as the campaign wore on, she was unable to articulate how she would be different from Biden. And Trump got more and more effective at painting her as an extremist. He ran ads saying things like “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” in the voice of a Black man. Sometimes campaigns are not just about what you say about yourself. Campaigns are about how the opposition is able to define you.The big problem for Democrats is there’s a powerful lingering perception that they are too progressive on some of these issues. And I don’t think anything short of an act of full-on repudiation is going to change that. Some kind of decisive action to distance themselves from that agenda—a kind of modern Sister Souljah moment. And Harris didn’t have any of those.Karma: I’m interested in what you think that kind of moment would look or sound like. Because one critique I think you could make of her campaign is that you can take moderate positions all you want, but what really tells voters you are serious is when you pick fights with your own side. And she didn’t really do that. She wasn’t getting in fights with the immigration groups or the racial-justice groups. And in areas where she did get into fights, like the corporate-price-gouging proposal, she pretty quickly backed down.Ruffini: I would put it almost exactly in those terms, because obviously conflict and controversy can be incredibly clarifying for voters. When the differences are subtle, voters are not necessarily going to get the message.Karma: But there is an area where the difference between the parties isn’t so subtle, and that’s on economics. Nonwhite voters are much more likely to vote their material interests and prioritize economic issues. And when you look at where the two parties stand on those issues, Democrats have embraced a very progressive, redistributive economic agenda. That’s included these huge investments in clean-energy and manufacturing jobs. Lowering prescription-drug prices. Expanding the child tax credit in a way that slashes child poverty. Meanwhile, Trump has sort of gone in the other direction: He’s promising huge corporate-tax cuts and joking with Elon Musk about firing striking workers. Wouldn’t you think that kind of difference would make working-class voters more likely to vote Democratic, not less?Rogé Karma: Trump isn’t even pretending anymoreRuffini: It’s true that nonwhite working-class voters in general are much more materialist. I simply just don’t think that those policies that you mentioned actually register in the same way as the underlying state of the economy. Maybe sometime down the road these things will bear fruit and Democrats will get credit for these programs. But the economic issue that matters most for voters right now is inflation. And that’s poisonous for the Democratic Party.Karma: We’ve really only seen this shift among nonwhite voters in the past two election cycles. How much of this is a product of just Donald Trump himself? And would these same shifts still hold in a future where a non-Trump figure was at the top of the Republican ticket?Ruffini: That’s the big question, because I think, in many ways, Trump ran the perfect campaign that was optimized to exactly this coalition.Karma: Okay, I have to stop you there. Because, if anything, I think the liberal perspective is that Trump ran a way more unhinged campaign. A way more dark, xenophobic campaign. Alongside some super gimmicky things like serving french fries at McDonald’s. So what about his campaign do you think was so good at breaking through?Ruffini: In response to the McDonald’s thing, you had some Democrats saying, “That’s crazy. That looks weird. The garbage-truck thing backfired.” But that’s the opposite of how it played. Trump was masterful in this election at crafting these images and these contrasts between him and Kamala Harris, where she was very cautious and scripted. And you’ve got that versus somebody like Trump, who is able to go on Joe Rogan and mix it up and just shoot from the hip for hours.Look, elections are not clinical exercises of people evaluating competing sets of policy proposals and making rational decisions. They are, in a sense, popularity contests and image-making contests. And something remarkable Trump did was, through the Musk endorsement and the podcast appearances and the UFC matches, he was able to bootstrap his own version of pop culture. And he was able to project that forward as something that voters in his target groups could gravitate toward.I think that was fundamental. And I think that very few Republicans or Democrats understand how to do it well.Karma: What advice would you give to Democrats who are dismayed by this election, by the fact that they’re losing so many of their core voters, and want to reverse that trend?Ruffini: I think the thing they can do to best respond to it is take a page out of Bill Clinton’s playbook. On the one hand, he openly repudiated some of the toxic tendencies within the party. But I think fundamentally what he did was, he was able to address himself as a change agent. People outside the political system don’t like Washington. And I think, unfortunately for the Democrats, their position right now, especially on these issues of democracy and upholding institutional norms, is just completely the opposite temperamentally of where most Americans are when it comes to institutions in Washington, D.C., and Beltway politics.Karma: Say more on that. It seems pretty clear that at its core, the college-versus-noncollege divide is really a high-trust-versus-low-trust-in-institutions divide. Why are Democrats losing those low-trust voters, and can they do anything about it?Ruffini: I understand why Democrats are so focused on the need to preserve democracy. Obviously, that’s a message a lot of people can agree with. But think about somebody who is disaffected, angry, who dislikes everything about traditional politics. When they hear that, they immediately think that this is a pro-system party. That this is a party that doesn’t share the dislike and distrust they have—maybe not of institutions generally but of Washington, D.C., in particular. And so I think it was a big mistake for Kamala, in the final days of her campaign, to pivot back to defending democracy with Liz Cheney at her rallies.Barack Obama was a change candidate. Bill Clinton was a change candidate. I think if they want to win back some of these voters, Democrats need to stop presenting themselves solely as the defenders of American institutions and instead as a party committed to change.More StoriesThe Two Donald TrumpsFive of the Election’s Biggest Unanswered Questions

CONTENT: A postelection conversation with staff writers Anne Applebaum and McKay CoppinsSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsHow do you know when a democracy slips into autocracy or fascism or some other less-free and less-savory form of society? Do they hang out a sign? Post it on X? Announce it on the newly state-controlled news channel? In the run-up to Donald Trump’s election, and even all the way back to his first administration, people who study autocracies in other countries have shown us how to spot the clues. One reliable teacher has been Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum, author of Autocracy, Inc. and co-host of the podcast series Autocracy in America. Over the years, Applebaum has situated Trump’s musings in a broader historical context. She’s pointed out, for example, that when Trump fired government watchdogs in his last administration or talked about deploying troops against protesters, those are actions that other dictators have taken.In the last few months of his campaign, Trump was free and open with his dictatorial impulses as he talked about punishing “enemies from within.” Now that he’s won, have we crossed the line into a different kind of country? In this episode of Radio Atlantic, Applebaum joins political writer McKay Coppins to help us know how to find the line. Does this resounding win mean the electorate gave Trump a mandate to act on all his impulses? Does he mean what he says? And how will we know?The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. So Donald Trump won. It’s looking like he won every swing state and, also, like there was a rightward shift even in the states he lost. He won even though, in the last months of his campaign, he was at his darkest and most crude. None of that mattered, apparently.So here to help us understand what happened are two Atlantic staff writers: Anne Applebaum, who covers threats to democracy—hi, Anne—Anne Applebaum: Hello.Rosin: —and political reporter McKay Coppins. Hi, McKay.McKay Coppins: Hey.Rosin: So, McKay, what do we know about how he won? The particular coalition, the demographics—what do we know so far?Coppins: Well, you just got at it. I think that the most surprising thing is not that he won—because the polls were so tight, and everyone was warning us to be prepared for either candidate coming out victorious—but the fact that he won so decisively, making gains in almost every state and almost every demographic group is something that I think most people were not prepared for.Just to run through a few of the highlights: He made major gains with Latino voters, according to exit polls. It depends on which exit poll you’re looking at, but Harris won Latinos by between eight and 15 points. That is a lot less than Biden’s roughly 30-point win among Latino voters four years ago.He made some more modest gains with Black voters, especially young Black men. A lot of Trump’s gains were concentrated with men. One exit poll showed him narrowly winning Latino men; the other one showed him narrowly losing them. But in either case, that is dramatically outperforming his performance in 2020.And so, you know, you take all this together, and what you see is that there is a rightward shift at almost every section of the electorate. And, you know, that includes parts of the Democratic coalition that Kamala Harris and her campaign thought they could take for granted coming into this race.Rosin: And is it just men? Like, everyone you mentioned were men. It’s like, Latino men, young Black men—Coppins: It definitely was. He definitely did better—Rosin: (Laughs.) Sorry, McKay.Coppins: (Laughs.) Not to speak for my entire gender here, but he did seem to do much better among men. Though, I will note that, coming into the campaign, a lot of Democrats had pinned their hopes on the idea that Dobbs would motivate a surge of women to support Harris.And we’re so early now that it’s still hard to tell from the exit-poll data how much that happened, but it is worth noting that Trump won white women in this election. He won them narrowly, but there was some hope among Democrats that Dobbs would push independent and even former Republican white women to the Harris camp. That does not seem to have happened in the numbers that they were planning for.Rosin: So all of that is somewhat surprising and things we have to reckon with over the next many months and years.Anne, you have been helping us understand, over many years, what it looks like when a country or democracy drifts towards autocracy. How do you read this moment?Applebaum: So I read this moment not so much as something new but as a continuation of things that we’ve seen in the past. I felt that, during the campaign, it would be useful for me to record some of the things the president was saying, to say how they echoed in history, to comment on how those things compared to what has happened in other countries.I did a podcast about this with The Atlantic. It’s called Autocracy in America. When he was last in the White House, Trump ignored ethics and security guidelines. He fired inspectors general and other watchdogs. He leaked classified information. You know, he used the Department of Homeland Security in the summer of 2020 as if it were the interior ministry of an authoritarian state, kind of deploying troops in American cities.Obviously, he encouraged the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. When he left the White House, he took classified documents with him, and then he hid them from the FBI. I mean, all those things are indicative of somebody who is in defiance of the rule of law, who thinks he’s above the rule of law, who’s seeking to avoid normal rules of transparency and accountability, who wants to help his staff get around, as I said, things like security, clearance, guidelines, and so on.And those things do represent a break with all previous presidents in modern history: Republican, Democrat, left wing, right wing—all of them. We didn’t have a president before who defied those kinds of rules and norms and laws and respect for some basic principles of the Constitution before.The fact is that people either liked it that he was doing that—they found the transgressiveness attractive, along with the language that he used about his enemies, you know, calling them “vermin” and the “enemy within” and so on. Either that was appealing—and, of course, that kind of language historically has been appealing; it does appeal to people—or they didn’t care.But that means that there has been a shift in how Americans see their government, what they understand the Constitution is for. And that shift clearly precedes Trump. I mean, probably he helped shape it during his first term. He helped shape it during the four years he was out of power. But we now have a country that is prepared to accept things from their leader that would have tanked the career of anybody else eight years ago.Rosin: So did you wake up on Wednesday morning and think, I live in a different country than I thought I did?Applebaum: No. I mean, I thought from the beginning of this election campaign—I thought it was possible that he would win. I mean, I suppose, particularly the last couple weeks of his campaign, when he became darker and darker and more and more vitriolic, you know, I wondered whether some of that would bother people.You know, the imagining guns trained at Liz Cheney, you know, talking about his enemies as the enemy within, talking about using the expression vermin or poison blood—these are terms that are directly taken from the 1930s and haven’t been used in American politics before. So I wondered whether people would be bothered by that.But am I entirely surprised that they weren’t? No, I’m not. I think the population is now immune to that kind of language, or maybe they like it.Coppins: Yeah, I would just say: I think that is one of the legacies of the Trump era, is how much he has successfully desensitized the country to this kind of rhetoric and behavior that, in an era not that long ago, voters would have deemed disqualifying.He has managed to convince enough Americans that this kind of behavior, this kind of rhetoric is okay or, at least, that it doesn’t matter that much. And looking forward, I do think that’s going to be something we live with in our politics long after Trump is gone.Rosin: I mean, there’s one way of looking at what you both are saying, which is: We woke up today; we have confirmation that we live in a failing democracy. But we actually don’t. All we have confirmation of is that people either don’t care that he talks like an autocratic ruler, they don’t notice, they like it, or they don’t put it in a broader historical context, which is that these are actual signs of actual autocracies, which happen all the time in history and across the world. Right? That’s all we know so far.Applebaum: Yeah, that’s all we know. That’s all we know. We also don’t know whether Trump will do some of the things that he said he would do. I mean, he talked about mass firings of civil servants. He talked about having people around him who were loyalists. That’s what political scientists would describe as “capturing the state”—so taking over government departments, government institutions, putting them not in the service of the nation and of everybody but making part of your political machine, using them for your political purposes.He talked about doing that. Will he try it again? Maybe, if he has a House and a Senate that will support him. As we’re speaking, we don’t know about the House, so we’ll see. They might make it easy. Will the judiciary support him? Some of it will. So will he do it? I don’t know.General John Kelly, who was his former chief of staff, has said that last time Trump was president, he talked about: We should investigate or get the IRS on—at that time he was talking about the former FBI director, James Comey, or his deputy, Andrew McCabe. Maybe now he’s talked about punishing Adam Schiff—who’s a congressman, now a senator, who he doesn’t like—or Nancy Pelosi.Will he do it? Will he use the IRS to go after people? I mean, that’s another thing that happens in failing democracies. And it’s also something that has happened in U.S. history before, so it’s not unimaginable.So I don’t know whether he’ll do these things, but it’s now on the record that he has said he would, or he said he wants to. In some of the documents written by people around him, there have been plans to do that. That’s what Project 2025 was, in part. And none of it bothered people, and so we have to assume that it’s a possibility.Coppins: I do think, to answer your earlier question, that it’s worth noting that, while a lot of voters went into the ballot box thinking about democracy—and in fact, according to one exit poll, around a third of voters said democracy was their top issue—a lot of voters were not thinking about these things, and they were not voting based on hoping that Donald Trump would weaponize the IRS against his political enemies. For example, a third of voters said the economy was their top concern. And I think when we talk about the shifts among those demographic groups, we have to acknowledge that a lot of it was a very simple response to groceries costing more, inflation being up, feeling like the economy was on the wrong track, and responding to a deeply unpopular incumbent president.And while we can sit back and look at the broad scope of history, it is clear that not all voters who went in to vote in these last few weeks were thinking about democracy. But I think it’s also good to point that out because Donald Trump is going to claim a mandate, coming out of this election, and say: I swept the swing states. The voters want me to have all this power. He’ll implicitly say, They want me to abuse my power. They’ve given me permission to do whatever I want. And I think that it’s worth noting that for a whole lot of people who voted for him, they just wanted him to make groceries cost less.Applebaum: Yeah, but that’s not really an excuse. I mean, you are, as a voter, obligated to know what the person you’re voting for stands for. And the responsibility of the president of the United States is not merely to control inflation. The president also has a lot of power over the U.S. government, over U.S. institutions, over American foreign policy, and by deciding you don’t care about those things, you do give him that mandate.Coppins: But my concern is that there’s a risk of a kind of democratic fatalism coming out of this election, where we will decide that: Look—Americans voted for this aspiring autocrat, therefore he will be an autocrat, and democracy has failed.And I think that it’s worth parsing this electoral data a little bit and acknowledging that a majority of Americans did not necessarily give him an autocratic mandate. Whether they were thinking about the things that they should have been thinking about, weighing the priorities the way that we think they should have been, I don’t think we should let—it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophecy if we let Trump and his allies claim that, because he’s said and done all these things and he won the election, he now has permission to do whatever he wants.Rosin: Yeah. One way of seeing the vote is that it wasn’t at all a referendum on Trump. It was people saying: My life was better in 2019, so I’m going with Trump. And I think why what you’re saying is important, McKay, is because people who didn’t vote for Trump can get discouraged and overwhelmed and tell themselves, People who voted for him voted for everything he stands for. And what follows from that is a sense of alienation. Like, This is not my country, and I don’t understand what’s going on.Anyway, Anne, you mentioned that Trump ran an explicitly vengeful campaign, that he would come after “enemies from within,” whether they were immigrants, Democrats, or us, the journalists. And you have taught us to take leaders’ words seriously. And yet a lot of people, not just voters, have said, Oh, this is hyperbole. Stop taking it so seriously. So how do we know the difference?Applebaum: We’ll know by his actions. Maybe it’s true that by saying those things and by acting out vengeance, maybe that was appealing to people who want some kind of vengeance, who are angry at whatever—the economy or the system or the establishment or the media or Hollywood or the culture—whatever it is that they’re angry at or feel deprived by, that he acted that out for them, and that was appealing to them. I’m sure that’s a piece of the explanation.And then another piece of the explanation is that there were people, like The Wall Street Journal editorial board or the writer Niall Ferguson, who said, Oh, these things just don’t matter. It’s just hyperbole. You know, That’s just how he talks. So we’ll see, and we’ll wait for it.Rosin: McKay, Project 2025, which came up a lot in the campaign and has been described as a blueprint for the next administration, includes transformative ideas about everything from abortion to tax policy. How much do you think that’s a realistic roadmap for what the administration might do?Coppins: I would take it seriously. I think that there is a risk that—because Donald Trump, realizing it was a political albatross around his neck, decided to distance himself in the final months of the campaign—that we collectively take him at his word, and I don’t think we should.I think that what he ends up doing in his next term will rely a lot upon who he appoints to his administration. I reported, back in December, that, in talking to people in Trump world about future appointees, the watchword was obedience. They talked about how Trump felt burned in his first term by appointees, people in his cabinet who saw themselves as adults in the room, who believed that their role was to constrain him, to keep the train on the tracks. And he doesn’t want people like that in his next administration. He doesn’t want adults in the room. He doesn’t want James Mattises or Mark Milleys or John Kellys. He wants absolute loyalists, either people who share his ideological worldview or, out of a sense of ambition or cravenness, are willing to do exactly what he says without questioning it.And so when you look at Project 2025 and the part of the plan, for example, that has to do with politicizing the civil service, taking 50,000 jobs in the federal bureaucracy and making them political appointees subject to the whims of the president, it will matter a lot whether he follows through on that and who those people are.A big part of Project 2025 was identifying loyalists, partisans, conservatives who could fill those roles. And so I think, when we talk through his next administration, what his agenda will look like, a lot of it comes down to this kind of truism of Washington that personnel is policy. So does Stephen Miller return to his administration in some kind of role where he gets to oversee immigration enforcement? It’s entirely possible, but that will make a big difference in terms of how much he follows through on his threats of mass deportation.Who does he appoint as attorney general? That was one role that everybody I talked to in Trump world told me he was very committed to getting right because he felt the two men who served in that role in his first term betrayed him. So is it somebody like Josh Hawley or Mike Lee or Ted Cruz? These are the questions that we’re going to have to be answering, and we’ll get a lot more clarity in the coming weeks and months as we see those appointees and those short lists emerge.[Music]Rosin: After the break, we’re going to get into what mass deportations under Trump could look like.Rosin: Something else I’ve been thinking about a lot that Trump has threatened is mass deportations. They are expensive. They’re actually quite difficult to carry out. They require a lot of manpower, local and national. Is that bombast? Is that a realistic threat? How will we know the difference?Coppins: Yeah. Again, this is where I think personnel will matter a lot, who is head of the Department of Homeland Security, for example. But just to go through what Trump promised on the campaign trail: He said that he would build massive detention camps, implement mass deportations at a scale never before seen in this country, hire thousands of additional border agents, use military spending on border security.He even said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel people who were suspected of being in drug cartels or gangs, without a court hearing.He said he would end “catch and release,” reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” policy. And I think it’s notable that he did not directly answer whether he would reinstate family separation, which was the most controversial aspect of his immigration policy in the first term.Take all these together—I think there are some of these things he could do pretty easily on his own with executive orders, and there’s not a lot of evidence that he could be constrained by the courts or by Congress. There are some things, like building massive detention centers, that would require a lot of money. Hiring thousands of more border agents would require a lot of money. So this is where control of Congress is going to matter a lot.Rosin: Are there others on his list that are top of mind for either of you? Aid to Ukraine is one that I’m thinking of. Are there others where you’re going to be vigilantly watching: Okay, he said X. Is he going to do X?Applebaum: Aid to Ukraine is in a slightly different category. It’s not about American autocracy and democracy. It’s a question of our position in the world. Are we going to remain the leader of a democratic camp, which is opposing the growing and increasingly networked autocratic camp? Will we oppose Russia, which is now in alliance with Iran and North Korea and China? Or will we not?And this, again, from Trump world, I know a lot of people who spent a lot of time in the run-up to the election trying to find out what Trump meant when he said, I’ll end the war in one day, which has been his standard response when asked about it. And you can literally find almost as many interpretations of that expression as there are people in Trump’s orbit.I mean, it ranges from, We’re just going to cut off all the funding, to, We’re going to give Ukraine to the Russians, to something quite different. There are people who said: No. We’re going to threaten the Russians. We’re going to tell them we’re bringing in a thousand tanks and a thousand airplanes unless you pull back. And so that’s another version that I’ve heard. There are versions that suggest offering something to Russia—you know, some deal. But honestly, I don’t know.Rosin: But those are legitimate foreign-policy debates. You can be an isolationist democracy. Those are not fundamental threats in your mind to the nature of this country and what it should be?Applebaum: No, although there are connections and have always been—we haven’t always acknowledged them—between America’s alliances and America’s democracy. So the fact that we have been aligned in the past with a camp of other democracies, that we put democracy at the center of our foreign policy for such a long time during the Cold War, was one of the reasons why our democracy was strengthened.It’s well known that during the Cold War, one of the reasons why there was an establishment shift towards favoring civil rights and the civil-rights movement was the feeling that: Here’s this thing we stand for. We stand for democracy. We stand for the rule of law, and yet we don’t have it in our own country. And there were a lot of people who felt that very strongly. And it’s not a bad reason why that happened, but it’s part of the explanation.You know, Who are your allies? Who are your friends? This affects, also, what kind of country you are and your own behavior. Who are your relationships? You know, if our primary political and diplomatic and economic relationship is with Russia and North Korea, then we’re a different kind of country than if our primary relationship is with Britain and France.Coppins: The only other kind of policy area that I’ll be keeping an eye on is tariffs. He has said that he would impose between 10 and 20 percent across-the-board tariffs on all U.S. imports and a 60 percent tariff on all Chinese goods.A lot of economic experts pointed out that this would very likely cause massive inflation. And given that he was just elected, in large part, on voter frustration with inflation, it’s an open question whether he’ll follow through on this. He clearly does not believe—and this is one of the few issues that he’s been pretty consistent on his entire life—he does not believe it would cause inflation. Almost every economics expert disagrees with him.And in his first term, there were people in the White House who blocked him from imposing more tariffs than he actually did, in fact to the point where we saw reporting from Bob Woodward that his staff secretary was literally taking executive orders off his desk before he could sign them and kind of losing them in the bureaucracy of paperwork. Will there be somebody like that this time? Will there be somebody who can get his ear and convince him not to go through with this? That is something that I think a lot of people will be looking at because the economic implications for this country and globally could be pretty profound.Rosin: And what are the bigger implications of tariffs? Like, that could just be a legitimate economic debate. Some people believe in tariffs. Some people don’t believe in tariffs. And it’s an experiment and, you know, economic protectionism.Coppins: I would not say that this is one of those kind of core democratic issues, that certainly, to various degrees, there have been protectionist policy makers and politicians in both parties over the last several decades. It could cause a trade war. It could interfere with our diplomatic relations with the countries that we’re imposing tariffs on. There are a lot of trickle-down implications.But yes, I do think it’s important. And I like that what you’re doing here is separating the issues that are kind of more typical policy disagreements from those things that Anne has been talking about, which are fundamental to American democracy. I don’t think tariffs are, but they could have an effect on a lot of Americans, and so that’s why I think it’s worth keeping an eye on.Rosin: Okay. There’s obviously going to be some resistance to Trump. Let’s start simple: McKay, who is going to be the leader of the Democratic Party?Coppins: So, obviously, if Democrats take control of the House, Hakeem Jeffries, the next speaker, would, I think by default, become the kind of leader of the Democratic opposition to Trump, at least for a while.If Democrats don’t take control of the House, I think it’s a very open question and, frankly, it’s one that Democrats probably should have been trying to answer two years ago. Joe Biden deciding to stay in the race after the 2022 midterms will probably go down as one of the most consequential political decisions in this era. The fact that he stayed in for so long, only to drop out in the final months of the election, meant that Democrats didn’t really have time to have the big intraparty debate about what they should stand for, who their standard-bearer should be.That debate will be happening now. And it’s going to be contentious and noisy and unsettling to a lot of left-leaning voters. I also think it’s healthy to have these conversations. And I think Democrats, in some ways, are kind of innately averse to that kind of contention. And I think that they might need to kind of get comfortable with it, because one way to look at the two elections that Donald Trump has won is that he really benefited from the fact that Democrats cleared the field for the two nominees he ended up beating: Hillary Clinton in 2016, Kamala Harris in 2024.One takeaway that I think a lot of Democrats will have is that Democrats need to decide that they’re okay with a little messiness in letting their voters decide who their nominee will be.Rosin: Anne, when other countries have faced a moment like this—a moment when you have to be vigilant, things are in the balance, the opposition feels alienated, it’s unclear who the opposition leaders are at the moment—how do you move through a moment like that? Like, how have other countries successfully moved to a healthier place?Applebaum: I mean, it almost entirely involves building broad coalitions. The only real example I can give: I live part of the time in Poland. We had an autocratic, populist government takeover in 2015. They did try to capture the state.They did it pretty successfully. They took over state media, which is a big deal in Poland, and they made it into a kind of propaganda tube. Poland has some state companies, and they took over the companies and began using the money to fund themselves and their party and so on. They enriched themselves, and they tried to create a system whereby they would never lose again.Remember that another sign of autocracy and a very, very important thing to watch for is corruption. Because when you remove guardrails and when you remove inspectors general and when you weaken the media, then it becomes much easier for people to be corrupt. And we’ve already got that problem in our system, and it’s going to get a lot worse.Essentially, what happened was the building of a coalition that went, in their case, from the center-left to the center-right—kind of center-left liberal, center-right—of people who wanted something. It was, in part, an anti-corruption coalition, so it wasn’t so much built around fighting for democracy, although that was a piece of it.The coalition was also seeking to fight against corruption and for good government. But it took eight years. It was a long process. And along the way, a lot of money was stolen. And the institutions declined, and the country is worse governed, and there are a lot of problems that are not going to be easy to solve.But there’s a look for coalitions. There was some internal soul-searching about what it was we did that—Why did we lose? But I’m not sure even how useful all of that was. I mean, what mattered, in the end, was the reconstruction of an opposition that had a clear message, that had a clear critique, and offered a vision of a different kind of future that was led by somebody who was charismatic.Rosin: Yeah. That is actually really useful, even to know that the coalitions don’t have to be for the restoration of democracy. They can be against mass deportation, against tariffs. Like, you can form coalitions, if you tell yourself, No, the voters did not give a mandate to Donald Trump to do whatever he wants and carry out all of his policies. That is not what happened in the last election, coalitions can form—popular coalitions—around all kinds of issues.Applebaum: Yeah. I mean, you could have a coalition that really cares about women’s issues and women’s rights and abortion rights. And you can have another one that really cares about the environment. And you can have another one that really cares about corruption. And you link them together, and then you have a movement.Rosin: Right.Applebaum: And that’s sometimes more effective. I mean, democracy is an abstract word that doesn’t necessarily mean things to people. It has to be made real through something that people experience. And maybe that’s how we have to look at it too.Rosin: Yeah. I think the thing that catches me in this election, which we haven’t quite touched on, is the truth-and-lies problem. I find that so overwhelming, like, the idea that people believe an untrue thing about what happened on January 6 and an untrue thing about what happened at Springfield, Ohio. And, as a journalist, I always find that an impossible barrier to cross. But maybe you’re suggesting ways to cross that barrier is: Well, people believe smaller truths.Applebaum: It’s one of the ways. We now have an information system that enables the creation of alternate realities. For me, one of the really striking things about the election campaign wasn’t so much Trump. It was Musk. Elon Musk, who owns a big and important social-media platform, was saying things that he must have known not to be true: falsehoods about immigration, about the election.He was allowing the platform to deliberately promote them. And he seemed to be doing that as a way of demonstrating his power. He was showing us that he can decide what people think. And he was working hard to create this alternate world in which things that aren’t true seem true. And that—I’m afraid it was really successful.Rosin: Right.Coppins: And the other thing that I think we’ve seen is that a big purpose of propaganda and disinformation is not even just to convince people that a certain thing is true but to almost exhaust their ability to tell the difference between what’s true and what’s not, and make them cynical and fatigued and disinclined to even try.I remember in 2020, I spent a lot of time covering disinformation in the campaign. And that was the thing that I would encounter when I talked to Trump voters. It wasn’t so much that they believed everything he said. Some would even acknowledge that he would lie or exaggerate. But they would throw their hands up and say: Yeah, they all lie, right? Who even knows what’s true? And that, I think, is the thing that we need to guard against over these next few years.Applebaum: That is the essence of Putinist propaganda. It’s not so much that you’re expected to believe everything he says about whatever, the greatness of Russia or the horror of Western civilization. But you’re expected to become so confused by the multitude and number of lies that you’ve been told that you throw your hands up in the air, and you go home, and you say, I don’t know anything. I can’t be involved in this. I don’t want anything to do with politics. I’m just going to live my life.And that turns out to be a really, really successful form of propaganda, probably more successful than the old-fashioned Soviet thing of telling everybody that everything is great, which you can disprove pretty easily.Rosin: Well, Anne and McKay, with your idea of coalitions, I had almost succeeded in finding us a practical path of thinking about a future. But now we’re back at this big veil of disinformation, which is not the place I want to end. Is there some way to turn that ship?I’ll ask you again, Anne: How have people turned that ship when you find a culture, a populace that’s just become cynical and overwhelmed by lies? How have other countries successfully crawled out of that disinformation?Applebaum: You build relationships of trust around other things. I mean, almost as we were just talking about, you find alternative forms of communication, all different ways of reaching people. That’s the only way.Rosin: All right. Well, Anne, McKay, we will have many more such conversations, but thank you for helping us be more discerning.Coppins: Thank you.Applebaum: Thanks.[Music]Rosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West and Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid.

CONTENT: F
ormer First Lady Melania Trump has been conspicuously absent on the campaign trail during her husband’s 2024 presidential election bid. Yet in a recent interview to promote her forthcoming memoir, Melania, Trump made a bombshell revelation on one of the most divisive issues of this election: abortion. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does to her own body?” asked the former First Lady.Not since the 1970s has the wife of the Republican presidential candidate taken such a clear pro-abortion-rights position during a campaign. This stands in stark contrast to Trump’s silence on the issue throughout her tenure as First Lady. Likewise, it distinguishes her from a long line of GOP First Ladies who have quietly disagreed with their husbands over abortion, hoping to avoid jeopardizing the party’s support from the religious right.Why has the otherwise silent Trump decided to speak out on this issue now? The state of the GOP may well have driven her to do so. We know this from the 1970s, the last time a Republican First Lady—Betty Ford—spoke out openly in support of women’s rights. Both then and now, the Republican party was undergoing an ideological reconfiguration, one which widened the gender gap. That opened up space for the First Lady to speak out on abortion without fear of damaging her husband’s chances in November. Trump's comments therefore tell us as much about the state of the GOP as they do about abortion.By the 1970s, the battle for the soul of the Republican Party was decades old. Conservatives had spent years building a movement to oppose the dominant brand of moderate Republicanism most associated with President Dwight Eisenhower and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Throughout the 1960s, rising conservatives, most especially Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, challenged the party’s orthodoxy. With the collapse of the Nixon Administration after Watergate and the decision by new President Gerald Ford to pardon his predecessor, the Republican Party found itself in crisis. Ford had to contend with leading Southern and Western Republicans pushing the party rightward as he attempted to navigate a way out of the national spiritual nadir. Women within the party were also engaged in a fierce battle, with conservative activists like Phylis Schlafly rising to the fore and demanding the party shed its historic support for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), legal abortion, and other feminist aims — and instead become the party of traditional conservative family values. The new First Lady, Betty Ford, was squarely on the opposite side of this debate.Read More: Melania Trump Shares Her Views on Abortion in New Interview—and Donald's ReactionAs the GOP underwent this fundamental identity crisis, abortion emerged as a core issue dividing the party.   It was in this context in August 1975 that Betty Ford sat down with 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer. He observed that abortion was “kind of a taboo subject for the wife of the President.” Despite that, however, Safer wanted to know what Ford thought about the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which ruled that the Constitution protected a woman’s right to have an abortion under some circumstances. Ford dismissed the idea that First Ladies shouldn't tackle the tough issue, instead remarking that she felt “very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion.”Knowing that the answer would infuriate the rising GOP right, the Ford Administration attempted to distinguish the First Lady’s views from those of the President and the Republican Party by noting that this was her own personal opinion. President Ford admitted to reporters after the interview aired that he anticipated losing millions of votes as a result of his wife’s comments, but he largely tried to remain neutral. The First Lady’s comments prompted a swift backlash, with Mormon Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, for one, condemning the interview in a CBS broadcast as part of a wider “deterioration of morality around the world.”The First Lady, however, wasn’t interested in ceding ground. She had a very different vision for the GOP. She wanted to see ratification of the ERA and protection for abortion rights. Mrs. Ford was not alone in this regard. She had the support of a cohort of Republican feminists including RNC co-chair Mary Dent Crisp.Yet, the tectonic plates of the party were already shifting. Betty Ford’s brand of bipartisan feminism was already becoming increasingly unfashionable. Republican feminists felt power slipping away as Ronald Reagan mounted a challenge for the Republican nomination in 1976. By 1980, when Reagan secured control of the GOP, Crisp was ousted from her position and ended up running John Anderson’s independent presidential campaign.Betty Ford kept pushing for women’s equality even after her husband lost in 1976, but her brand of moderate Republicanism waned as the 1970s progressed. Reagan’s ascendency solidified the shift of the GOP to the right. Abortion remained front and center as a political issue—not just a women’s issue—as the Reagan Revolution reshaped the American political landscape. In 1980, for the first time in 40 years, the GOP dropped support of the ERA from its platform. The battle to ratify the Amendment fizzled out, even after Congress extended the deadline to 1982. As moderates left the party, Reagan courted the newly organized Christian Right and First Lady Nancy Reagan followed suit. The new First Lady personally opposed abortion but quietly supported women’s right to make the choice for themselves. Yet Mrs. Reagan refused to make this declaration in public, knowing that such a stance would enrage her husband’s Evangelical supporters. In 1984, when a Los Angeles Times reporter asked her about exceptions to allow abortion in instances of rape, Nancy Reagan replied, “I don’t know.” This response forced her staff to clarify that the First Lady “had no obligation to explain her position further, because she is not an elected official or a person seeking office.” It was not until 1994—years after her husband had left the White House—that she made her personal opinions on the matter known.Read More: Roe v. Wade Lawyer 'Amazed' Americans Still Fighting Over AbortionReagan’s successor, Barbara Bush, also obscured her pro-abortion-rights position during her husband’s presidency. When pressed on the issue during his 1992 reelection campaign, she dodged, instead stating that abortion was a personal choice and that the issue should not be in the party platform “either pro or con.” Her statement shocked activists on either side of the issue. Pro-abortion-rights activists denounced it as a deliberate play to prevent liberal voters from defecting from the GOP while conservatives attempted to play Mrs. Bush's stance down, wary that it would cost her husband votes from the right.Bush’s daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, did go on the record stating that she did not believe that the Roe decision should be overturned in an interview the day before her own husband’s inauguration in 2001 but largely abstained from discussing abortion since “I’m not running.” All three women’s husbands maintained staunch anti-abortion positions and pushed anti-abortion policies.The silence of the three Republican First Ladies stemmed from the alliance of the GOP with the Christian Right, which left minimal space for them to support abortion access as loudly as Betty Ford had done. Additionally, with Roe protecting these rights, it may have been easier to justify not speaking out as loudly.Melania Trump similarly said nothing about abortion rights during her husband’s presidency. But in 2022, the Supreme Court reshaped the debate over women's reproductive health by overturning Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health—a direct result of appointments made by Trump's husband. The decision eliminated the constitutional right to have an abortion, and hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections. Donald Trump has worked to muddy his stance on the issue, even claiming he would veto a national abortion ban.This changing GOP climate created a space for Melania Trump’s voice to be heard on abortion. Just as the party underwent a period of demographic reconfiguration in the 1970s, the current GOP is at a pivotal moment where it is transforming from the Republican Party that existed from the 1980s to 2020s — a party of traditional conservatism and moral values — to the GOP of Donald Trump the individual. Melania speaking out may well be an attempt to sway undecided voters who are not social conservatives but remain unconvinced by the Democratic establishment and open to a potentially loosely ideologically defined Trumpism. It’s also a bid to try and capture women’s vote at a time when, after Dobbs, the gender gap is wider than ever. Her stance on abortion is a reminder to voters that not only are reproductive rights on the ballot in November, but so too is the future of the Republican Party itself.Elizabeth Rees is a postdoctoral fellow at Southern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History in Dallas, Texas.

CONTENT: If Trump wins the presidency again, conservatism will be homeless, a philosophy without a party, for at least a generation.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.Many republicans would say that it is one thing, and quite an awful thing, to withhold a vote from Donald Trump—but that voting for Kamala Harris, a “San Francisco Democrat,” is nothing short of a betrayal, an act of apostasy, impossible for any true conservative to justify.They’re wrong, though in one respect it’s understandable why they’re wrong. Harris is hardly an avatar of conservatism. She is, after all, a lifelong Democrat who, in her ill-fated campaign for president in 2019, positioned herself as a progressive champion. She embraced positions that I believe ranged from silly to harmful. But it’s a more complicated story than that.During Harris’s pre-Senate career, when she served as district attorney in San Francisco and then as attorney general of California, her record was generally pragmatic and moderate. In those roles, according to Don Kusler, the national director of Americans for Democratic Action, her record was one “that would have many liberals, particularly our California colleagues, angered or at least rolling their eyes.” Progressives had a much deeper relationship with President Joe Biden than with Vice President Harris; according to The Washington Post, “They fear that under Harris they would lose the unique access they had to the West Wing.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate faction in the House, says it’s the part of the caucus most closely aligned with Harris.Read: This is Trump’s messageNor are progressives particularly happy that during the 2024 campaign, Harris has broken with some of her previous liberal stances, such as opposing fracking, decriminalizing border crossing, and ending private health insurance. Harris has spent the closing stretch of the campaign appearing with the likes of Liz Cheney, not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has emphasized her support for Ukraine in its war of survival against Russia, and risks losing Michigan because she is viewed by some in her party as too supportive of Israel. During the campaign, Harris has shared that she owns a Glock, said she’d appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, and declared that she’s a “capitalist” who wants “pragmatic” solutions. Her economic focus is on tax breaks for the middle class and on creating opportunities for small businesses. Her economic plan, the Post points out, contained few items on the liberal wish list. Progressive groups say they are finding a “significant enthusiasm deficit” among left-wing voters.It would be an affectation to say that Harris is a conservative champion, just as it would be a caricature to portray her now as a far-left liberal. She is neither, and if she’s elected president, she is likely to govern from the center-left, at least on most things.But the strongest conservative case for voting for Harris doesn’t have nearly as much to do with her as it has to do with her opponent. Trump remains a far more fundamental threat to conservatism than Harris. Trump has, in a way no Democrat ever could, changed the GOP from within and broken with the most important tenets of conservatism. That’s no surprise, because his desire isn’t to conserve; it is to burn things to the ground. In that respect and others, Trump is temperamentally much more of a Jacobin than a Burkean. He has transformed the Republican Party in his image in ways that exceed what any other American politician has done in modern times.Start with character. The GOP once championed the central importance of character in political leaders, and especially presidents. It believed that serious personal misconduct was disqualifying, in part because of the example it would send to the young and its corrosive effects on our culture. It lamented that America was slouching towards Gomorrah.In 1998, when a Democrat, Bill Clinton, was president and embroiled in a sexual scandal, the Southern Baptist Convention—whose membership is overwhelmingly conservative —passed the “Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials,” which said, “Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God’s judgment.” It added, “We urge all Americans to embrace and act on the conviction that character does count in public office, and to elect those officials and candidates who, although imperfect, demonstrate consistent honesty, moral purity and the highest character.”Yet for a decade now, Republicans, and in particular white evangelicals, have celebrated as their leader a felon and pathological liar; a person whose companies have committed bank, insurance, tax, and charity fraud; a sexual predator who paid hush money to a porn star; a person of uncommon cruelty and crudity who has mocked the war dead, POWs, Gold Star families, and people with disabilities. Under Trump, the party of “family values” has become a moral freak show.Trump has also profoundly reshaped the GOP’s public policy. The GOP is now, at the national level, effectively pro-choice, and, due in part to Trump, the pro-life movement is “in a state of political collapse,” in the words of David French, of The New York Times. The Republican Party, pre-Trump, was pro–free trade; Trump calls himself “Tariff Man” and referred to tariff as “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” (In July, Trump proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10 to 20 percent, and rates of 60 percent or higher on imports from China.) He epitomizes crony capitalism, an economic system in which individuals and businesses with political connections and influence are favored.For several generations, Republican presidents have, to varying degrees, promoted plans to reform entitlement programs in order to avert fiscal catastrophe. Trump has done the opposite. He has repeatedly said that entitlement programs are off-limits. As president, Trump shredded federalism and made a mockery of our constitutional system of government by his use of executive orders to bypass Congress. He made little effort to shrink government, and lots of efforts to expand it.On spending, $4.8 trillion in non-COVID-related debt was added during Trump’s single term, while for Biden the figure is $2.2 trillion. Trump added more debt than any other president in history. A Wall Street Journal survey of 50 economists found that 65 percent of them see Trump’s proposed policies putting more upward pressure on the federal deficit than Harris’s, and 68 percent said prices would rise faster under Trump than under Harris. And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Trump’s policies would increase budget deficits by $7.5 trillion over the next decade, compared with $3.5 trillion for Harris.Pre-Trump Republican presidents celebrated the diversity that immigrants brought to the nation, and the contributions they made to America. “All of the immigrants who came to us brought their own music, literature, customs, and ideas,” Ronald Reagan said in a speech in Shanghai in 1984. “And the marvelous thing, a thing of which we’re proud, is they did not have to relinquish these things in order to fit in. In fact, what they brought to America became American. And this diversity has more than enriched us; it has literally shaped us.” George W. Bush urged America to be a “welcoming society,” one that assimilates new arrivals and “upholds the great tradition of the melting pot,” which “has made us one nation out of many peoples.”Trump is cut from a very different cloth. He curtailed legal immigration during his presidency. Temporary visas for highly skilled noncitizen workers were reduced. Refugee admissions were slashed. Trump, who peddled outrageous lies against Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, says he plans to strip them of their legal status. (At his rallies, Trump has whipped the crowds into a frenzy, getting them to chant, “Send them back! Send them back! Send them back!”)Read: Under the spell of the crowdEdith Olmsted pointed out in The New Republic that during his first term, Trump rescinded Temporary Protective Status orders for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Nepal, and Honduras, “placing hundreds of thousands of legal residents at risk for deportation.” Trump, who refers to America as an “occupied country” and “a garbage can for the world,” also said he plans to reinstate a ban on travelers from some countries with Muslim-majority populations. And although previous Republicans have attempted to slow illegal border crossings, none has dehumanized those crossing the border by using language from Mein Kampf (“poisoning the blood of our country”). Trump believes American national identity is based not on allegiance to certain ideals but on ethnic and religious background.It is in foreign policy, though, that Trump may be most antithetical to the policies and approach of modern conservatism. Reagan was a fierce, relentless opponent of the Soviet Union. “The one thing Reagan was more passionate about than anything else was the unsupportable phenomenon of totalitarian power, enslaving a large part of the world’s population,” according to Edmund Morris, a Reagan biographer.Trump is the opposite. He admires and is enchanted by the world’s most brutal dictators, including Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, and others. Trump is at best indifferent to the fate of Ukraine in its war against Russia; one suspects that deep down, he’s rooting for his friend Putin. Reagan mythologized America; Trump trash-talks it. Reagan was a great champion of NATO; Trump is a reflexive critic who, according to his former national security adviser John Bolton, would withdraw from the alliance in a second term. Reagan made human rights a centerpiece of his foreign policy; during his term, Trump praised China’s forced internment of a million or more Uyghurs as “exactly the right thing to do,” according to Bolton.Here and there, now and then, Trump is conservative—on court appointments, for example—but it’s something that he’s stumbled into, for reasons of political expediency, and that he’s just as liable to stumble away from. (Trump was pro-choice before he was pro-life before he moved once again toward the pro-choice camp.) Trump is fundamentally a populist and a demagogue, a destroyer of institutions and a conspiracy theorist, a champion of right-wing identity politics who stokes grievances and rage. He has an unprecedented capacity to turn people into the darkest versions of themselves. But he is something even beyond that.In recent weeks, Trump has been called a fascist—not by liberal Democratic strategists, but by people who worked closely with him. They include retired General John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff; retired General Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump presidency; and Mark Esper, Trump’s former secretary of defense, who has said that Trump has fascistic “inclinations” and is “unfit for office.” In addition, retired General James Mattis, who also served as Trump’s secretary of defense, has said he agrees with Milley’s assessment. And Dan Coats, Trump’s former director of national intelligence, has said he suspects that Trump is being blackmailed by Putin.The historian Robert Paxton, one of the nation’s foremost experts on fascism, was initially reluctant to apply the term fascism to Trump. The label is toxic and used too promiscuously, he believed. But January 6, 2021, changed all of that.“The turn to violence was so explicit and so overt and so intentional, that you had to change what you said about it,” Paxton told Elisabeth Zerofsky, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. “It just seemed to me that a new language was necessary, because a new thing was happening.”Trump’s “open encouragement of civic violence to overturn an election crosses a red line,” Paxton wrote in Newsweek shortly after Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol. “The label now seems not just acceptable but necessary.”Paxton could add to the parade of horribles the fact that Trump encouraged the mob to hang his own vice president, came very close to deploying 10,000 active-duty troops to the streets of the nation’s capital to shoot protesters, invited hostile foreign powers to intervene in our election, and extorted an ally to find dirt on his opponents. Paxton could have mentioned that Trump threatened prosecutors, judges, and their families; referred to his political opponents as “vermin” and the “enemy from within”; and called the imprisoned individuals who stormed the Capitol “great patriots.” He could have cited Trump’s call for the “termination” of parts of the Constitution and his insinuation that Milley deserved to be executed for treason.Trump’s supporters may be enraged by the fascist label, but they cannot erase the words or the deeds of the man to whom the label applies. And the only way for the GOP to become a sane, conservative party again is by ridding itself of Trump, which is why even conservatives who oppose Harris’s policies should vote for her. Harris’s election is the only thing that can break the hold of Trump on his party.Acquaintances of mine, and acquaintances of friends of mine, say that they find Trump contemptible, but that they can’t vote for Harris, because they disagree with her on policy. My response is simple: The position she once held on fracking may be bad, but fascism is worse. The position she holds on any issue may be bad, but fascism is worse.Read: Trump wants you to accept all of this as normalA friend told me he won’t vote for either Harris or Trump. If Trump wins a second term, he said, “I suspect he will give more attention to his golf game than to siccing the IRS, FBI, or whoever on his political opponents.” His message to me, in other words, is to relax a bit. Trump may be a moral wreck, but he won’t act on his most outlandish threats.My view is that when those seeking positions of power promote political violence, have a long record of lawlessness, are nihilistic, and embody a “will to power” ethic; make extralegal attempts to maintain power and stop the peaceful transfer of power; and use the words of fascists to tell the world that they are determined to exact vengeance—it’s probably wise to take them at their word.If Trump wins the presidency again, conservatism will be homeless, a philosophy without a party, probably for at least a generation. And the damage to America, the nation Republicans claim to love, will be incalculable, perhaps irreversible. The stakes are that high.Harris becoming president may not be the best thing that could happen to conservatism. But if she becomes president, she will have prevented the worst thing that could happen to conservatism and, much more important, to the country.More StoriesDon’t Give Up on the TruthThis Election Is Different

CONTENT: V
ery rarely does the right movie arrive at precisely the right time, at a moment when compassion appears to be in short supply and the collective human imagination has come to feel shrunken and desiccated. Jacques Audiard’s operatic musical Emilia Pérez is the story of a disillusioned lawyer working in Mexico, Zoe Saldaña's Rita, who’s almost too successful for her own good. She has just successfully defended a media mogul accused of murdering his wife, though she knows he's guilty. But before her self-loathing can solidify into a comfortable habit, she gets a phone call—a mysterious, growly entity wants to meet with her. She’s whisked, blindfolded, to a secret location, where the gruff leader of a drug cartel, Juan “Manitas” Del Monte, face a map of tough-guy tattoos, outlines a delicate but lucrative mission for her. Manitas wants to transition to living as a woman and wants Rita to arrange both the surgery and subsequent disappearance. Rita pulls it off: It takes a few years, but Manitas re-emerges into the world as the person she always knew she needed to be. She is now Emilia Pérez (Karla Sofía Gascón plays both roles), free to live life as she chooses. Rita, well compensated as promised, runs off to London to live the high life. She thinks her mission is over, though it’s really only just beginning.In fiction, and sometimes even in real life, it's too easy to view the fulfillment of a dream—having a wedding ring slipped onto your finger, overcoming great odds to earn a college degree, maybe even undergoing gender-affirmation surgery—as a happy ending. But after Emilia gets exactly what she wants, then she asks, Now what? Emilia Pérez is a story not about personal fulfillment but about personal responsibility, the “what happens next?” after you become the person you were destined to be.If you set a Douglas Sirk movie in modern Mexico, and added singing and dancing, you might come up with something like Emilia Pérez, which is now streaming on Netflix. Audiard drew the screenplay from an opera libretto he’d written, adapted loosely from a novel by French author Boris Razon, Écoute. (The film was shot entirely in France, on faux-Mexico sets.) The plot turns may feel zany at first, but once you get into the movie’s groove, they come to make perfect emotional sense. When Rita first meets Emilia, four years after she and Manitas have parted ways, she of course doesn’t recognize her. The menacing, muscular thug she’d met earlier—who was, even so, a doting family man, devoted to his two kids and their mother, Jessi, played by Selena Gomez—is now a vixen with a seductive, throaty voice. Rita had already helped get Manitas’ family settled in Switzerland; having no knowledge of their patriarch's secret, they believe him to be dead. But now Emilia has another request for Rita, one that’s almost more challenging, and more dangerous, than the first. Emilia wants to make amends for the suffering she caused in her old life; she also longs to reconnect with her family. And because no one can escape loneliness, she yearns for companionship, too. She meets a woman whose scrappy spirit matches her own, Epifanía (Adriana Paz, in a warm, radiant performance), though that relationship also comes with its own complications.Read more: The 33 Most Anticipated Movies of Fall 2024Audiard orchestrates the craziness of the plot with the assurance of an ace conductor. The musical numbers are exuberant, extravagant in feeling, without being overly polished. This isn’t a movie about showing off how much money you’ve spent but about how willing you are to go for broke. And it’s fantastic to see Saldaña—who, long ago, played a rebellious ballerina in Nicholas Hytner’s Center Stage, the sort of girl who extinguishes a cigarette butt on the pavement with one stomp of her dainty pink toeshoe—sing and dance in a vehicle worthy of her. “El Mal” is a Bollywood-inflected number decrying the hypocrisy of people who are happy to show up at a fancy benefit dinner even as, in their everyday lives, they have no qualms about killing those who stand in their way. Saldaña prowls through the song with angry swagger. Rita is a complex character: she has principles, but she’s also motivated by money. There’s nothing goody-goody about her. Saldaña makes those dimensions feel believable and real.It's kismet that Saldaña somehow found her way into a Jacques Audiard movie. There’s no easy way to categorize his filmmaking career: over the years he’s made, to cover just three examples, a gorgeous melodrama about two people clawing their way out of tough circumstances (Rust and Bone), a bold and inventive western (The Sisters Brothers), a gritty romance about a crook who dreams of becoming a pianist (The Beat That My Heart Skipped). Actually, the idea of “dreaming of becoming” is probably the key to most of Audiard’s movies, and certainly to Emilia Pérez. He has discovered a great star to bring his ideas to life. Gascón, who was born and raised near Madrid, is in her early fifties; she transitioned at age 46, and she has spent the bulk of her career acting in Mexican telenovelas. In Emilia Pérez, she’s incandescently alive. As Manitas, she shows us a man who’s more than ready to give up his macho authority—he makes his case, piercingly, in the delicate but resolute “Deseo”—though we’ll later see that a tendency to manipulate others still lingers in Emilia’s character. She’s lots of things at once, because all humans are. Gascón’s performance is bold, assertive, but also blazingly tender. There’s a Mildred Pierce–style practicality about her, though she can also be as sultry-sunny as Lana Turner. She has a knack for putting us in touch with big emotions, no matter how much we might want to push them away.As it turns out, roughly half the country is now having to work through some big emotions they’d rather not have to feel. In the 1990s, in the more liberal corners of the United States, you couldn’t pass more than three Honda Accords without seeing a “Practice Random Acts of Kindness” bumper sticker. Even those who cherished liberal ideals would roll their eyes: that kind of sloganeering was for people who made their own granola, who could find a peace march to join every weekend. They probably had a composting pile. And like many bromides, it could mean different things to different people: a white-supremacist granny who goes out of her way to make cookies for a bereaved neighbor might think she’s fully in compliance.Read more: The 100 Best Movies of the Past 10 DecadesBut at the risk of dropping a bomb from the water-is-wet department: Boy, has the world changed. Or at least our view of it in the United States. Emilia Pérez premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last May; it won the Jury Prize, and its four women actors, Gascón, Saldaña, Gomez, and Paz, took home a combined Best Actress award. I saw the film first in Cannes and again in early fall, before the election. And while most people I knew liked it, or at least derived some pleasure from it, I had a conversation with two people who despised it, claiming it didn’t accurately represent the experience of trans individuals at all.Though it's impossible, obviously, for a movie to reflect the experiences of a nonmonolithic group of people, lived experience certainly counts for something when we’re talking about art. No one has to like, or approve of, anything, for artistic reasons or any other. But the very existence of Emilia Pérez—and the fact that so many people have already responded to it—means something different in late fall 2024 than it did in May. Even many well-meaning, liberal-thinking Americans have tended to tiptoe delicately around the issue of trans rights, constantly in fear of offending or mistakenly using the wrong terminology. Now that those rights are even more imperiled than before, a movie like Emilia Pérez—one that, instead of pleading for trans acceptance merely treats it as a given—feels even more like movie fireworks, fierce and glorious, a radical act of the imagination with kindness in its heart. Audiard’s film is a challenge to find the beginning that comes after the end. It’s not about trans possibility, but about human possibility. Because they’re one and the same.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: The sociologist Julia Sonnevend distinguishes between two kinds of performance that matter in public life.To understand modern politics, including the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns, distinguishing between two qualities—charisma and charm—is vital. They are different kinds of political magnetism. And thanks to the sociologist Julia Sonnevend, I’ll never conflate them again.In her book Charm: How Magnetic Personalities Shape Global Politics, she defines charisma as the German sociologist Max Weber did––a quality by which an individual “is set apart from ordinary men.” Possessing it does not make a leader morally better or worse. Think of Charles de Gaulle, Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill—larger-than-life figures who communicated through exceptional rhetorical performances. Their charisma required distance from the audience.Charm requires proximity. It is the “everyday magic spell politicians cast,” Sonnevend writes. To succeed in today’s media environment, “political leaders must appear as accessible, authentic, and relatable,” she argues, catering to a desire for familiarity—not a faraway figure embodying the nation but a person with whom we’d like to grab a beer.That doesn’t mean charisma is a relic of the past. When Barack Obama gave formal orations in large stadiums where he stood in front of staged classical pillars, he was aiming for charismatic performances. But Obama was trying to charm us when he filled out NCAA brackets and shot hoops. Trump renting out Madison Square Garden this weekend appears to be an attempt at a charismatic event. But his preparation of fries at McDonald’s was intended to charm.Read: The power of oddball charm“Charm is a defining feature of contemporary politics, not just in the United States but internationally,” Sonnevend told me recently at an event in New York City hosted by the intellectual community Interintellect. “If you analyze politics without considering it, you are missing a core component,” she insisted. “There’s a stronger focus on personality than before. We have to understand how it operates.”To clarify how her ideas can help us understand the United States—and the distinct relationships that Trump, Harris, J. D. Vance, and Tim Walz have with charisma and charm—I visited Sonnevend at the New School, where she is an associate professor. What follows is a condensed, edited version of our conversation, where I learned that charm works partly because almost all of us want to be seduced.Conor Friedersdorf: Trump always wears a suit and tie. He rose to fame as a billionaire CEO behind a boardroom table. He loves hosting huge rallies. Kamala Harris isn’t as good at big arena speeches. She has tried to avoid traditional interviews. But people in small groups and more informal settings seem to find her likable and relatable.Is Election 2024 charisma versus charm?Julia Sonnevend: Harris in many ways is a great example for the charm category if you think of the dancing videos, the cooking videos. There was a viral tweet where someone suggested that instead of formal interviews, she should go on the Food [Network] and cook—all the people urging her: “Maybe you actually shouldn’t do that traditional appearance.” “Maybe these intimate settings offer a better chance for success.” “Show the power of charm and the value of everyday interactions.” Still, in debates, wearing formal dress and a flag pin, she is attempting charisma.Trump is a more complex case. He has a strong charismatic component. If I think of the assassination attempt––how he realized, This is the moment in which I’m going to generate that iconic photograph with the raised fist. He had the composure to create that kind of moment, which is a more charismatic situation. You don’t feel like you would do it. It is not ordinary.Some of my students argue that Trump has no charming component. But when he is telling personal stories or saying “You guys are the same as me” in a Bronx barber shop or wearing the red baseball cap––you know, that’s not a regular kind of accessory with the super-formal business suits––then there are elements that are forms of charm. Most politicians try a mix of charisma and charm, even if they lean closer to one or the other.Friedersdorf: Why do voters care about charm more than they once did?Sonnevend: One reason is the changing media environment. It has become increasingly possible to give almost continuous access to politicians—or that’s the illusion. Think of our phones, these totemic objects we all carry—the intimacy of sitting in bed with the screen close to your face, watching a politician record a video or a livestream of themselves with their own phone. That’s different from sitting in the living room, watching a TV set where a leader is on a stage.In everyday life, there are so many moments when we are not fully ourselves, when we feel awkward during a meeting or an interview or a date. Yet in our politics, we want a steady performance of authenticity from leaders, without it being too polished or fine-tuned a performance. We know that attempts at charm are highly constructed. But if it works, you don’t feel like it’s a performance. Everyday settings become normal sites of politics, like Jacinda Ardern, then–prime minister of New Zealand, at home in a gray hoodie, recording a video announcing, I just had a conversation with President-elect Joe Biden.
Friedersdorf: What about when attempts at charm fail?Sonnevend: The chance of failure rises with every attempt. And the feeling the audience has when it fails is often cringe. The fine line between successful performances of charm and cringe is interesting. These attempts at proximity aim to make you feel, Okay, that’s actually him; he’s authentic; I’ve gotten to know him. But in some cases you feel that there’s an attempt to deceive or manipulate, or that the person shares too much. Charming people excel at making you feel you’ve gotten to know them while maintaining boundaries and avoiding cringe.Read: Trump is speaking like Hitler, Stalin, and MussoliniFriedersdorf: So an example of cringe would be that J. D. Vance trip to the doughnut shop, where his interactions with staff seemed awkward and stilted rather than natural?Sonnevend: Yes. Vance is not charming. He is better in the charismatic setting of the formal debate. Tim Walz is the opposite. He is better at charm.Friedersdorf: As a young woman, my grandmother would go to movie premieres in Hollywood to see 1950s movie stars on the red carpet. In her older years, she would scoff dismissively at shows like Access Hollywood and tell me, “I feel sorry for your generation. The stars don’t shine anymore.” She felt, to borrow Us Weekly’s tagline, that the stars were “just like us,” and that was a bad thing. In catering to our desire for exposure, do politicians lose something, and that fuels our contempt for them?Sonnevend: There is a sort of magic that we are losing. If you introduce viewers to your private life, you lose the magic of distance that is core to charisma, this stardust you can never touch. There is a difference between being a godlike character and the illusion of a guy you can have a beer with. The sheer amount of access makes it less exciting. Think about the Royal Family and how difficult it becomes to have all these fans who start to know too much, then the inevitable controversy about what people think of those particular details.Still, you get another form of magic with charm.Friedersdorf: What’s an example of someone who lost a bit of the magic that comes from distance while gaining a bit of the personal magnetism that comes from familiarity?Sonnevend: I saw Princess Diana as a kind of icon when I was growing up in Communist Hungary, with barely any commercial products available. She was, to me, the first example … of this distant character who was magical, a princess.But what I remember discussing with my mother for hours and hours were Princess Diana’s marital troubles and how to solve them. I had access to this very mundane form of unhappiness that she displayed in maybe a performative way. We felt we knew her deep-rooted unhappiness and her marriage despite living in circumstances so different from hers.Friedersdorf: Perhaps there is no stable sweet spot. As humans, do we always crave more intimacy when confronted with mystery, and more mystery when confronted with intimacy?Sonnevend: We may see cyclical processes in politics where a country has a charming, charismatic leader for a while until they get fed up, want change, and choose a more bureaucratic process for a while.Sometimes we are deceived by charming people––abusers, fraudsters, charming psychopaths, sociopaths. A long list of people have this quality, and authoritarian leaders can have it. So I’m not saying celebrate every aspect of it. There is a dark side to charm.At the same time, I think we all want to be seduced. Charm is enormously important in everyday life, whether we accept it or not. It matters very much whether your kid has a charming teacher. It matters to the New School that we have a charming president. It matters in fundraising but also in the everyday mood and feel of the university, because charming people shape organizations. Charm is not in itself good or bad. And I really try to go against what I see as the hypocrisy of saying I don’t want to have anything to do with seduction.Read: Trump has turned over a new leafFriedersdorf: So you would say that, even in politics, charm’s importance is less a choice than a fact to deal with?Sonnevend: I think we are trained, particularly on the left, to be critical of performance. And I feel we should be more honest in acknowledging that performance is crucial to politics. It doesn’t mean it’s the only factor––that policy or other factors don’t matter. But it is a defining feature.You have fragmented, disillusioned audiences that are bored by politics and often don’t even follow it, because we think it’s too much. If you have a charming character who can bring a bit of seduction and magic to our lives, that can reinvigorate and energize politics. And there is a risk and that dark side to charm. I don’t think we should adopt an easy answer, that charm is a magical process we all need or a disaster to fear. We should recognize its presence in social life and reflect on it as it arises, trying our best to understand it.More StoriesThe Case for Treating Trump Like a Normal PresidentThe Case for Explorers’ Day

onald Trump may have won the presidency partly because voters were fed up with inflation. But if he enacts many of the policies he proposed on the campaign trail, voters may see prices continue to rise, according to economists, analysts, and business owners.“There’s a lot of inflationary pressure in his promises,” says Simon Johnson, one of the 2024 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics and a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Business. Trump has said he would enact tariffs of 60% on goods from China and tariffs of at least 10% on all imports into the U.S. The cost of those tariffs will be paid by consumers buying the imported goods. The President-elect said he would oversee the biggest mass deportation of undocumented people in U.S. history, which could lead to labor shortages in industries like agriculture. He’s also pledging more tax cuts, which could boost consumption, setting off more inflation. Put together, economists say his proposals could drive up the costs of apparel, toys, appliances, and food. Trump’s own allies have sometimes acknowledged as much in the lead-up to the election; Elon Musk, for example, warned of “temporary hardship” for ordinary Americans as Trump enacts his plans, including government spending cuts. The cost of tariffsTrump has consistently advocated for imposing tariffs on imported goods in an effort to keep manufacturing in the U.S. The amounts he’s proposed have been as high as 60% on goods from China, 25% on goods from Mexico, and 10%-20% on goods from everywhere else.While Trump has claimed that foreign countries pay these tariffs, in reality, the importer pays them, absorbs what they can, and passes the rest on to the consumer. The Budget Lab at Yale has estimated that the Trump tariffs would initially drive up consumer prices by up to 5.1%.If consumers pull back on spending as a result, that will create challenges for U.S. companies. “It’s going to raise our costs of the goods we sell, which has a huge impact on our ability to be profitable,” says Lanny Smith, the founder of Actively Black, a Black-owned athleisure wear company. Smith has tried to move production out of China to sidestep the brunt of Trump’s proposed tariffs, but hasn’t been able to find quality suppliers elsewhere. Even U.S. factories import fabrics from Asia, making them subject to the tariffs as well. Smith dreads raising prices on an inflation-weary public. “The consumer is going to be mad at us,” he says. “They don’t understand that if we don’t raise our prices, we won’t be able to survive.”Read More: What Donald Trump's Win Means For AI.Apparel and footwear could see big price increases if tariffs are imposed, says Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Unless you’re in the military, about 98% of everything in your closet is imported, he says. If companies decide not to raise their prices, they’ll practice a kind of clothes “shrinkflation”—for example, putting fewer features on a shirt but selling it for the price of a fancier shirt.It’s not just clothes that will see prices increase if the tariffs are implemented. Many consumer electronics are made in China. They would be affected by Trump’s proposed blanket 60% tariff—and their operations are so complex that it could be very difficult for them to move manufacturing away from their current locations. Toys and sporting goods could also see big cost increases. The stock prices of companies like Wayfair, Five Below, and Dollar Tree have fallen since Trump’s victory because those companies import many goods from China. Other apparel companies who import a lot of their goods from China include Five Below, Skechers, Crocs, and American Eagle, according to a research report from Bank of America. One thing many people don’t understand about tariffs is that they tend to drive up the cost of U.S.-made goods too, says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That’s because the makers of the U.S. goods have less competition from overseas, and more demand from consumers looking for the lowest price. One 2019 study found that the price of domestic washing machines and dryers went up after Trump’s tariffs on imported washing machines. “American consumers are very likely in for some sticker shock,” Lovely says.Read More: What Donald Trump's Win Means For Abortion.Dan Digre’s company MISCO has made speakers in Minnesota for decades—his father started the business in 1949. He’s betting on making products in America, but Trump’s proposed tariffs could make it harder for him, he says. Digre imports some parts from China to run his business, and the first Trump Administration enacted a tariff of 25% on those parts, which put him at a competitive disadvantage since the tariff on imported speakers was only 7%. A 60% tariff would make Digre reconsider whether he could still build speakers in the U.S.. If he built the speaker in Vietnam, for instance, he wouldn’t face a tariff. “We’re disincentivizing companies like ours to continue to make things in America if we’re punished for getting the parts we need in a global market,” he says. Digre doesn’t see why the country, which has just suffered through years of inflation, would want to implement a tariff, which is basically the same as adding a tax on to the beginning of his production cycle. “That tax cost now gets passed to everybody,” he says. Mass deportationsTrump has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in American history and end Temporary Protected Status for certain migrants who have been cleared to work in the country. Both of those policies could have big impacts on what Americans pay for their food. It’s not just farm workers who would be affected, though roughly half of all farm workers are undocumented, says David Ortega, a food economist and professor at Michigan State University. There are hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers in restaurants, food production, and the grocery sector, Ortega says. Replacing them would drive up labor costs, ultimately leading to higher food prices. “This could have far-reaching impacts on our food system,” he says. Ironically, losing big swaths of the undocumented workforce would mean that the U.S. could have to rely more on imported food, which could be subject to the tariffs Trump wants to impose on foreign goods.Fiscal and monetary policyJohnson, the Nobel prize winner at MIT, thinks Trump’s plan for tax cuts will also create inflationary pressure. Tax cuts could free up more money for consumer spending, leading to another cycle when too much money is chasing too few goods in the economy. Trump may also try to bully the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates. The Fed, which operates autonomously, raises rates to cool the economy and lowers them to help boost it. Trump has said he thinks the President should have a say in how rates are set. In his first term, he pressured the Fed to cut interest rates. Trump does not have legal authority to fire Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, and Powell has signaled that he will dig in and continue to operate independently if Trump tries to apply pressure. But Powell’s term ends in 2026, at which time Trump could appoint a Fed chair more sympathetic to his take on monetary policy.There is, Johnson says, one upside as Trump promises big changes in the U.S. economy. The more unstable the world appears, the more investors put their money into safe international assets. That’s good for the U.S. dollar, because it pushes down long-term interest rates, making it cheaper for businesses, people, and the U.S. government to borrow money. “He has an incentive to threaten chaos,” Johnson says, “since that will lower his borrowing costs.”CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: How to watch the election without falling for conspiracy theoriesProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Election Night is upon us, with all of its nail-biting anxiety, its cortisol-driven fear, and, for roughly half the country, the possibility of ecstatic relief after another surreal presidential campaign.Results could take days, even weeks, to shake out. But the state of the race could also reveal itself surprisingly quickly. At 7 p.m. eastern time tonight, polls will close in the battleground state of Georgia. At 7:30 p.m., polls will close in North Carolina, another crucial toss-up. Both swing states are known for counting their ballots quickly, because of state laws that allow them to tally early and mail-in votes before Election Day.Read: Election anxiety is telling you somethingSo when will we know the results, how can we sensibly extrapolate the early returns, and—perhaps most important—what information and analysis should we ignore? David Wasserman, a political analyst with the Cook Political Report, joined my podcast, Plain English, to explain how to watch the election returns like a pro—without falling for false hope or conspiracy theories. Here are three tips for following Election Night without losing your mind.Wait, what? Aren’t Kamala Harris and Donald Trump essentially tied in national and swing-state polling averages? Didn’t Nate Silver put the odds that Harris will win this election at an exquisitely decimaled number between 50.00 and 50.99 percent? Isn’t there a nonzero chance that both candidates win 269 electoral votes?Yes, yes, and yes. “This is the closest election in polling that I’ve covered in my 17 years, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to produce the closest result,” Wasserman told me. The 2016 and 2020 elections were absurdly close contests, both of them decided by about 78,000 votes. But, he said, “even elections as balanced as 2024 aren’t likely to hinge on 80,000 votes distributed across a handful of states.” Close polling does not predict historically close elections.To understand what Wasserman means, perhaps a sports analogy is useful. Both sports betting and political polling try to express uncertain future events in the language of probabilities. The 2016 and 2020 elections were a bit like Super Bowls that went into overtime—something that’s happened only twice in the game’s six-decade history. Let’s say the next Super Bowl, in 2025, looks like a statistical dead heat, with two 13–4 teams with the exact same point differential. Let’s furthermore say that Vegas sports books throw up their hands and declare the game a “pick-’em,” meaning neither team is favored to win. Even with all of this balance, it’s still very unlikely that the game will go to overtime, because so few games ever go to overtime. It’s the same with this election. We are still a normal polling error from either Trump or Harris winning the seven closest swing states, which would be a decisive victory.Brian Klaas: The truth about pollingWe don’t know how to forecast future events in any language outside of probabilities, and it’s hard to make peace with a world of probabilities. If you flip a coin 10 times, the median outcome is five heads and five tails. But you shouldn’t expect that 10 flips will yield five heads, because that outcome has less than a 25 percent chance of occurring. You’re actually three times more likely to get a number of heads other than five. So don’t get too invested in any particular electoral map. It’s very unlikely that your highly specific prediction will come to pass, and that includes an election decided by 80,000 votes.Exit polls are exciting, because they provide a morsel of data during a highly anxious evening when audiences and news organizations are starving to know what’s going to happen in the next four hours, or four days. But there’s nothing particularly special about an exit poll. In many ways, it’s just another poll, but with a larger—and possibly misleading—sample. Exit polls might actually be less useful than other public-opinion surveys, Wasserman said, because the majority of voters now cast their ballots before Election Day.If you’re watching a newscast that’s making a huge deal out of exit polls, it might have more to do with the need to fill time before we get actual election results. Rather, if you want to get an early sense of how things are trending on Election Night, the best thing to do is focus on county-level results that report the complete tally of votes. That means you’ll also want to avoid being overconfident about election results that are incomplete.By the end of the night, we’re likely to have nearly complete results from counties in Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan. Here are a few to watch:If you’re looking for a coin-flip county in a coin-flip election, it’s hard to find a better one than Nash, just outside North Carolina’s Research Triangle. According to Wasserman, the county has been decided by fewer than 1,000 votes in every presidential race since 2004. In 2016, out of about 47,000 votes counted, Trump won by fewer than 100 ballots. In 2020, out of about 52,000 votes counted, Joe Biden won by fewer than 200 ballots. If Harris keeps Nash in the Democratic column, it would suggest that she can fight Trump to a draw in poorer areas while she racks up votes in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.Listen: It could all come down to North CarolinaMetro Atlanta makes up most of Georgia’s vote, and Cobb County is packed with the sort of highly educated suburban dwellers who have shifted left in the Trump years. In 2012, Mitt Romney won Cobb by more than 12 percentage points. In 2020, Biden won the county by 14 points. For Harris to win the election, she’ll need double-digit margins in highly educated counties like Cobb across other swing states.Although most eyes will be on Atlanta’s Fulton County, Wasserman told me that he’ll also be scrutinizing smaller and midsize Georgia counties, such as Baldwin County. Just outside Macon, in the middle of the state, Baldwin County is about 40 percent Black, and as a college town, it has a lot of young people. In 2016, Baldwin voted for Hillary Clinton by 1.7 percentage points. In 2020, Biden won it by 1.3 points. If Trump breaks through in Baldwin, Wasserman said, “it would be a sign that Harris is perhaps underperforming in both turnout and vote preference among younger Black voters and young voters” across the country.How will we know if polls yet again undercounted Trump’s support among white men without a college degree? By looking at working-class counties like Saginaw, where Democrats won cycle after cycle before 2016. No Republican presidential candidate had won the plurality of votes in Saginaw since 1984, until Trump carried the county by just over one percentage point against Clinton, only for Biden to claw Saginaw back into the Democratic column by a mere 0.3 percentage points in 2020. “This is a place where organized labor powered Democrats to victory for many years,” Wasserman said. “If Trump wins Saginaw by five points, it’s going to be very difficult for Harris to overcome that.”More StoriesHow Donald Trump Won EverywhereThe New Law of Electoral Politics

CONTENT: W
hen I became Disabled in my late teens and started searching for work, I was confronted with barriers including disability discrimination, inaccessible environments, and attitudinal biases. I lost a job simply because a no-cost adaptation was rejected. My story isn’t unique. And it’s just one example of how systemic barriers prevent Disabled people from accessing meaningful employment.Another huge one: a nearly 90-year-old federal law from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that allows employers to pay Disabled people less than the minimum wage, sometimes just cents on the dollar. At last, Congress is seriously considering legislation that would end this relic of the New Deal, better known as Section 14(c), which confines Disabled people to a lifetime of poverty and segregation. President Biden campaigned to end this discriminatory federal program, which is run by the U.S. Department of Labor, and disability rights advocates have been working with bipartisan Congressional champions like Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia, and Republican Senator Steve Daines of Montana and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, to get the Transition to Competitive Integrated Employment Act (TCIEA) across the finish line as the 118th Congress wraps up after the election. Republican leaders including Neil Romano are championing the reforms.When President Roosevelt signed the FLSA of 1938, this was a landmark law that established minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor protections, but it initially excluded several groups of workers. When it was first passed, agricultural workers, domestic workers, and others, many from marginalized communities, including Black and immigrant workers, were not covered by its protections. This was largely due to political compromises to gain support from Southern Democrats, who wanted to maintain the status quo of labor practices that benefited from the exploitation of these workers.Read More: I’ve Been Paralyzed Since I Was 3. Here’s Why Kindness Toward Disabled People Is More Complicated Than You ThinkOver time, the FLSA was amended to include some of these previously excluded groups. In 1966, agricultural and restaurant workers gained coverage under the Act, and in 1974, domestic workers were included. But in 2024, Disabled workers are still legally allowed to be paid less than the minimum wage based on their productivity. While efforts to phase out this exclusion have grown in recent years, Disabled workers remain the only group still legally subject to subminimum wages under federal law.States like Alaska, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Vermont have already abolished Section 14(c), proving that a fair and equitable labor market for Disabled workers is possible. Additionally, red states like Utah have taken significant steps toward ending Section 14(c). It's time to take this reform to the federal level. The intent of Section 14(c) was to allow employers, particularly sheltered workshops, to pay Disabled workers based on their productivity compared to non-disabled workers. The idea was that by offering subminimum wages, employers would be incentivized to hire Disabled workers who might otherwise be excluded from the workforce. However, it has become a convenient loophole for employers to secure cheap labor while exploiting Disabled workers without facing any consequences. By allowing these practices to continue, we are enabling the exploitation of an already marginalized group, further entrenching them in poverty rather than providing opportunities for growth and independence.The notion that pay should be tied to productivity is fundamentally flawed, especially when we consider that non-Disabled workers are rarely, if ever, paid based solely on their productivity. In most industries, non-Disabled employees are compensated at a standard rate, regardless of their individual output, and factors like seniority, education, or company role often play a much larger role in determining pay. If all workers, regardless of disability, were paid strictly on productivity alone, it would expose the absurdity of this metric as a fair gauge of value. Productivity fluctuates based on numerous factors such as workplace environment, job accommodations, and access to resources—factors that disproportionately affect Disabled people due to the systemic barriers they face.Section 14(c) only masks a much bigger problem: the broken and inaccessible systems that limit opportunities for Disabled people.Read More: Why Businesses Must Stop Disregarding People With DisabilitiesWe need to reform systems that confine Disabled people to decade-long state waitlists to receive necessary home and community based services, that limit upward mobility to move states and change careers, and that restrict our community to asset and income limitations that equate to a lifetime of poverty. This isn’t the American Dream—a disincentive to work, choosing between gainful employment and essential support, perpetuating poverty and making it nearly impossible to accumulate savings or financial stability.Many Disabled people are forced to create their own businesses because traditional employment is inaccessible—that’s what I did, frustrated by my own struggles and the lack of disability representation. Whether it’s inaccessible workplaces, subminimum wages, or societal biases, the barriers Disabled people face in employment are countless. We are often forced into entrepreneurship, and yet Disabled entrepreneurs are 400 times less likely to receive venture capital than their non-disabled peers.This is ironic given the labor shortage and the demand for creative, adaptable workers, qualities Disabled people inherently possess from navigating a world not designed for us. Despite this, Disabled people are twice as likely to be unemployed in the U.S., and those with intersectional identities face even higher rates. Perhaps the most significant barrier is societal attitudes, negative perceptions and assumptions about Disabled people’s capabilities. Many employers still hold the bias that Disabled people are less capable, less productive, or require too many accommodations to be worth hiring. According to the Center for Talent Innovation, 62% of employees with disabilities have “invisible disabilities,” and many don’t disclose them due to fear of discrimination. Addressing these barriers requires policy changes and a fundamental shift in the way we view disability in the workplace. We need to recognize that Disabled people bring valuable skills and perspectives, and that with the right access, they can succeed just as well, if not better, than their non-disabled counterparts, and that we all, if we are lucky enough to live long lives, will become disabled at some point. Disability is a natural part of human diversity. As we reflect on the myriad of challenges our community faces and how we hold our elected leaders accountable, we must start by abolishing subminimum wage. Then we can work to advance proactive federal solutions that will create accessible, inclusive pathways to employment and entrepreneurship. Having had to carve out my own path when traditional employment shut its doors, I am committed to ensuring that no other Disabled person is ever forced to do the same. But if they choose to, they should have the funding, support, and access needed to succeed on their own terms.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: George Orwell famously argued that clear language in politics can be a bulwark against oppression. But in the Trump era, his solution no longer holds.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.1984 ends not with a bang, but with a grammar lesson. Readers of George Orwell’s novel—still reeling, likely, from the brutal dystopia they’ve spent the previous 300-odd pages living in—are subjected to a lengthy explanation of Newspeak, the novel’s uncanny form of English. The appendix explains the language that has been created to curtail independent thought: the culled vocabulary; the sterilized syntax; the regime’s hope that, before long, all the vestiges of Oldspeak—English in its familiar form, the English of Shakespeare and Milton and many of Orwell’s readers—will be translated into the new vernacular. The old language, and all it carried with it, will die away.With its dizzying details and technical prose, “The Principles of Newspeak” makes for a supremely strange ending. It is, in today’s parlance, a choice. But it is a fitting one. Language, in 1984, is violence by another means, an adjunct of the totalitarian strategies inflicted by the regime. Orwell’s most famous novel, in that sense, is the fictionalized version of his most famous essay. “Politics and the English Language,” published in 1946, is a writing manual, primarily—a guide to making language that says what it means, and means what it says. It is also an argument. Clear language, Orwell suggests, is a semantic necessity as well as a moral one. Newspeak, in 1984, destroys with the same ferocious efficiency that tanks and bombs do. It is born of the essay’s most elemental insight: “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”The essay, over the years, has enjoyed the same backhanded success that Orwell himself has. Its barbs have softened into conventional wisdom. Its enduring relevance has consigned it, in some degree, to cliché. Who would argue against clarity?But the essay, today, can read less as a rousing defense of the English language than as a prescient concession of defeat. “Use clear language” cannot be our guide when clarity itself can be so elusive. Our words have not been honed into oblivion—on the contrary, new ones spring to life with giddy regularity—but they fail, all too often, in the same ways Newspeak does: They limit political possibilities, rather than expand them. They cede to cynicism. They saturate us in uncertainty. The words might mean what they say. They might not. They might describe shared truths; they might manipulate them. Language, the connective tissue of the body politic—that space where the collective “we” matters so much—is losing its ability to fulfill its most basic duty: to communicate. To correlate. To connect us to the world, and to one another.And semantic problems, as Orwell knew, have a way of turning into real ones. Violence descends; threats take shape; emergencies come; we may try to warn one another—we may scream the warnings—but we have trouble conveying the danger. We have so much to say. In another way, though, we have no words.Earlier this month, donald trump mused aloud about the violence Americans might anticipate on November 5. If Election Day brings havoc, he told Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo, the crisis would come not from outside actors but instead from “the enemy from within”: “some very bad people,” he clarified, “some sick people”—the “radical-left lunatics.”The former president further mused about a solution to the problem. “I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the National Guard,” he said, “or, if really necessary, by the military.”A presidential candidate who may well retake the White House is threatening to use the military against American citizens: The news here is straightforward. The language that makes the news, though, is not. The words twist and tease, issuing their threats in the conditional tense: It should be. If necessary. Trump’s words often do this; they imply very much while saying very little. They are schooled, like the man himself, in the dark art of plausible deniability. In them, Orwell’s doublespeak—that jargon of purposeful obscurity—gets one more layer of insulating irony: The former president says whatever he wants, and reserves the right not to mean it.Do we take him at his word? The answer to this question, on which so much else depends, can only ever be “maybe.” When he describes “the enemy from within”—or when he muses about police forces fighting back against criminals for “one real rough, nasty day,” or when he announces his intention to spend the first day of a second term acting as “a dictator”—you could read each as a direct threat. You could assume that he’s lying, embellishing, teasing, trolling. You could say that the line, like Trump’s others, should be taken seriously, but not literally. You could try your best, knowing all that is at stake, to parse the grammar of his delusion.But the fact that you need to translate him at all is already a concession. The constant uncertainty—about the gravest of matters—is one of the ways that Trump keeps people in his thrall. Clear language is a basic form of kindness: It considers the other person. It wants to be understood. Trump’s argot, though, is self-centered. It treats shared reality as an endless negotiation.The words cannot bear the weight of all this irony. Democracy is, at its core, a task of information management. To do its work, people need to be able to trust that the information they’re processing is, in the most fundamental way, accurate. Trump’s illegibility makes everything else less legible, too.Read: Do you speak Fox?Orwell published “Politics” at the end of a conflict that had, in its widespread use of propaganda, also been a war of words. In the essay, he wrestles with the fact that language—as a bomb with a near-limitless blast radius—could double as a weapon of mass destruction. This is why clarity matters. This is why words are ethical tools as well as semantic ones. The defense of language that Orwell offered in “Politics” was derived from his love of hard facts. “So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information,” he confessed in his 1946 essay “Why I Write.” His was an elegant dogma. Words matter because facts matter—because truth matters. Freedom, in 1984, is many things, but they all spring from the same source: the ability to say that 2 + 2 = 4.One october surprise of 2024 took an aptly Orwellian turn: The scandal, this time around, was a matter of language. Earlier this month, John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, escalated his warnings that his former boss is unfit for office. Kelly told The Atlantic that Trump had expressed a desire for generals like the ones “that Hitler had.” Then, in an interview published by The New York Times, Kelly described Trump’s dictatorial approach to leadership, his drive to suppress opposition, his insatiable appetite for power. He concluded that Trump fits the definition of fascist.Kelly’s claim was echoed, more mildly, by Trump’s former secretary of defense—he “certainly has those inclinations,” Mark Esper said—and, less mildly, by Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump is “the most dangerous person to this country,” Milley warned in Bob Woodward’s latest book, its publication timed to coincide with the election. He is also, Milley added, “fascist to the core.” (Trump denied the men’s claims: “I am the opposite of a Nazi,” he said.) Late last week, 13 others who had served in high-level positions in the Trump administration signed an open letter: “Everyone,” they wrote, “should heed General Kelly’s warning.”The comments made headlines because of the people who expressed them: Each had worked directly with Trump. The former officials made history, though, because of the word they deployed in their warnings. Fascist is a claim of last resort. It is a term of emergency. Because of that, its validity, as a description for Trump’s seething strain of populism, has been the subject of a long-standing debate among scholars, journalists, and members of the public—one made even more complicated by the fact that, as the historian Ian Kershaw has observed, “Trying to define ‘fascism’ is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.”But one need not be a scholar of fascism to see the plain reality. Trump lost an election. He refused to accept the result. In a second term, he has suggested, he will “terminate” the Constitution, use the American judicial system to take revenge on those who have angered him, and perform sweeping immigration raids, expelling millions of people from the country. Trump, in addition to praising Hitler’s generals, regularly uses language that echoes Hitler’s hatreds. He has described immigrants, whatever their legal status, as a formless “invasion,” and the press as “the enemy of the people.” He has dismissed those who are insufficiently loyal to him as “human scum” and “vermin.”Read: This is Trump’s messageFascism—that call to history, that careful description, that five-alarm piece of language—is the right word. But it may turn out, at the same time, to be the wrong one. It might, in our cynical moment, provoke exhaustion rather than alarm.In “Politics,” Orwell reserves particular vitriol for political language that hides its intentions in euphemism and wan metaphor. Wording that resorts to ambiguity can disguise atrocities (as when, in one of the examples Orwell offers, the bombing of villages and their defenseless people is referred to merely as “pacification”). Orwell’s problem was language that gives writers permission not to think. Ours, however, is language that gives readers permission not to care. Even the clearest, most precise language can come to read, in our restless age, as cliché. “The first man who compared woman to a rose was a poet,” the old line goes; “the second, an imbecile.” On the internet, anyone can become that imbecile. For language in general, this is not an issue: When on fleek goes off in an instant or cheugy plummets from coinage to cringe, more words will arrive in their place.When the restlessness comes for political language, though—for the words we rely on to do the shared work of self-government—the impatience itself becomes Orwellian. Urgent words can feel tired. Crises can come, but no words suffice to rouse us. Americans face an election that our democracy—hard-fought, hard-won, ever fragile—may not survive; “defend democracy,” though, can read less as a call to arms than as a call to yawn. Trump himself is insulated by all the ennui. Nearly every word you might apply to him fits the picture that was already there. His depravity has become tautological: It’s just Trump being Trump. It’s shocking, not surprising.The word fascism can fail that way, too. And it can be further defanged by the biggest cliché of all: thoughtlessly partisan politics. Some audiences, seeing the word deployed as a description, will dismiss it as simply more evidence of the media’s (or John Kelly’s) alleged bias against Trump. Others, assuming that fascism and Nazism are the same thing—assuming that fascism cannot be present until troops are goose-stepping in the streets—will see the term as evidence of hysteria.But fascism can come whether the language acknowledges it or not. It marches toward us, restricted right by restricted right, book ban by book ban. It can happen here. The question is whether we’ll be able to talk about it—and whether people will care. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released last week asked registered voters across the country whether Trump was a “fascist” (defined as “a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents”). Nearly half of respondents, 49 percent, said he was—roughly the same percentage of people who, in recent national polls, say that they plan to vote for him.The philosopher emilio uranga observed, in Mexican political life of the mid-20th century, a gnawing sense of uncertainty—a “mode of being,” he wrote, “that incessantly oscillates between two possibilities, between two affects, without knowing which one of those to depend on.” The unsteadiness, he suggested, amounts to pain. In it, “the soul suffers.” It “feels torn and wounded.” Uranga gave the condition a name: zozobra.The wound he describes, that plague of doubleness, has settled into American political language. In her 2023 book, Doppelganger, Naomi Klein describes the “mirror world” in right-wing politics—a place where every reality has a rhetorical double. She focuses on the rhetoric of Steve Bannon, the former Trump-administration strategist. As Democrats and journalists discussed the Big Lie—Donald Trump’s claim that he won the 2020 presidential election—Bannon began discussing the Big Steal: the idea that Joe Biden, against all evidence, stole the presidency.The tactic is common. Trump regularly fantasizes before his cheering crowds about the violence that might befall his opponents. Journalists describe him as engaging in “extreme” and “inflammatory” rhetoric. Republicans in Trump’s camp, soon enough, began accusing Democrats of, as one of his surrogates put it, “irresponsible rhetoric” that “is causing people to get hurt.” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham’s response to the former military leaders’ warnings about Trump took a similar tack: Their rhetoric is “dangerous,” he said this weekend. On Monday, Trump gave John Kelly’s comments about him a predictably zozobric twist. Kamala Harris, he said, is a fascist.“In the mirror world,” Klein writes, “there is a copycat story, and an answer for everything, often with very similar key words.” The attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, has commonly been described as an insurrection; Republican power brokers have begun describing peaceful political protests as “insurrections.” We must save American democracy, the stark slogan that gained new currency in response to the Big Lie, is now a common refrain on the right. (Elon Musk, at a recent Trump rally, argued that the former president “must win to preserve democracy in America.”)Mirroring, as propaganda, is extremely effective. It addles the mind. It applies a choose-your-own-adventure approach to meaning itself. Mirroring does, in that way, precisely what Orwell feared: It gives up on the very possibility of common language. It robs political terms of their ability to clarify, to unite, to warn. In a world that is endlessly doubling itself, 2 + 2 = 4 may be a liberating truth. Or it may be a narrative imposed on you by a smug and elitist regime. Freedom, soon enough, becomes the ability to say that the sum of 2 + 2 is whatever you want it to be.Read: Why are we humoring them?The words fly, flagrant and fast; the definitions that might ground them trail, meekly, in their wake. But when the words are mere slogans—shibboleths and signifiers, narrowcast to one’s tribe—dictionary definitions miss the point. Slogans are rhetoric. They are advertising. They are vibes. They can function, in that way, as what the author Robert Jay Lifton called “thought-terminating clichés”: words or phrases that effectively curtail debate—and, with it, critical thought itself. Last year, an author who wrote a book decrying the “woke indoctrination” of children struggled to define what woke actually means. In 2022, the New York Times editorial board effectively declared lexicographic defeat: “However you define cancel culture,” it wrote, “Americans know it exists and feel its burden.” On Tuesday, Musk—who has been spreading his Trump-friendly brand of groupthink on his social-media platform, X—shared an image: a man, his face obscured, wearing a green cap. Stitched onto the hat, in large, all-caps letters, was make orwell fiction again.In 1990, a conservative republican group headed by Newt Gingrich sent a pamphlet to Republican candidates running in state elections across the country. The document amounted to a dictionary: 133 words that operatives might use to elevate themselves (family, freedom, pride) and vilify their competitors (decay, corruption, pathetic, traitors). The pamphlet was titled, unironically, “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control.” Many in the media, nodding to the Orwell of it all, came to know it as “Newtspeak.”The 1990s were years when politicians were translating the insights of postmodern discourse (the power of “framing” and the like) into the everyday practice of politics. But Gingrich’s memo turned spin into a plot twist. Every word of its grim new language represented an argument: that Democrats were not merely opponents, but enemies; that the differences between the two sides were not merely political, but moral. It recast American politics not as an ongoing debate among equals, but as an epic battle between good and evil. The core aim of propaganda, Aldous Huxley observed, is to make one group of people forget that another group is human; the pamphlet, cheerfully promising aspiring politicians that they could learn to speak like Newt, wove that logic, word by word, into Americans’ political habits.The language in the pamphlet is stark. It is evocative. It is so very, very clear. It also takes the advice Orwell gave to preserve the thing he most loved and puts it in service of the thing he most feared.Orwell watched the rise of communism. He fought the rise of fascism. He observed, from a distance and, at times, from intimately close range, the blunt-force power of words. He saw how quickly a common language could be transformed into a divisive one—and how readily, in the tumult, new hatreds and fears could settle into the syntax of everyday life. And he knew that history, so rarely consigned to the past, would repeat—that the battles of the 20th century would very likely be refought, in some form, in the future.He knew all that, but he could not know it all. And there are moments in “Politics and the English Language” that can read, today, as nearly naive, with its faith in facts and its hope that clarity could be our salvation. Orwell was a satirist, too—1984, he believed, was an example of the genre—but he did not account for the ways that irony could come for language itself. He did not imagine propaganda that does its work through winks and shrugs rather than shouts. He did not sense how possible it would become for people in the future, seeking his wisdom, to wonder whether use clear language offers any counsel at all.This is not Orwell’s failing, necessarily. And it need not be our own. If we look to him for refuge and find none, that means simply that we will have to use the words we have to create new advice, new axioms, new ways forward. We can take the insight that drove him—that words can expand the world, or limit it; that they can connect us to one another, or cleave us—and seek new means of clarity. We can treat language not just as a tool, but as a duty. We can keep remembering, and reminding one another, that 2 + 2 = 4.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

CONTENT: Inflation, moderation, and candidate effectsSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsIn the aftermath of Donald Trump’s victorious reelection bid, Democrats are searching for an explanation of Kamala Harris’s loss in order to begin rebuilding for the future. So it goes every election cycle—a loss, a scramble for causality, and competing narratives begin to set.Just one week out from Election Day, there are multiple dissenting and overlapping arguments being made to try to make sense of the results. In 2016, many Democrats believed that Trump’s attack on trade policies was core to his victory. As a result, the Biden-Harris administration pursued Trump-like policies on trade, none of which seems to have made a significant difference in increasing the union vote share, reducing Trump’s likelihood of victory, or stemming the flow of working-class voters out of the Democratic Party.Now, again, various parts of the Democratic coalition are seeking to define the party’s loss. But what do we actually know about why the Democrats were defeated? There are still theories forming, but on today’s episode of Good on Paper, I talk with the former Republican strategist and current host of The Bulwark Podcast, Tim Miller, about the postelection narratives jockeying for power.“But for those of us who do have a belief that there’s something kind of special about the American system and that have revered America, that understand that America is flawed and has made mistakes, that still is a unique experiment in the world. That ‘America is an idea’ type of thing. The idea is pretty dim at this point,” Miller argued.The following is a transcript of the episode:[Music]Jerusalem Demsas: In the aftermath of a bruising electoral loss, the losing party begins participating in a well-worn democratic tradition: slinging takes about what happened.This is democracy! When the voters send a dissatisfied response, the messy work of recalibration requires parsing the signal from the noise.Were voters mad because of a global inflationary environment that no Democrat could dig their way out of? Did they want to see specific breaks between Harris and Biden on policy? Were they frustrated by a candidate they saw as too left on cultural issues?There are data points in favor of many different theses. Here’s where I’d put my stake in the ground, with the caveat that we still don’t have a complete analysis on subgroup dynamics, or even a final vote count on all the races:First, incumbents worldwide were facing tough election odds. Electorates were frustrated by the COVID inflationary years and were clearly seeking change. In Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and beyond, ruling coalitions lost power across the political spectrum.Second, I don’t think Kamala Harris was ever going to be a great candidate. After Biden’s disastrous debate effort in late June and it seemed he might be pressured to drop out, I wrote an article calling on Democrats not to coronate their vice president, and pointing to key vulnerabilities she displayed and the value of an open democratic process.Figuring out how much of this is in the campaign’s control—would it really have mattered that much if she’d gone on Joe Rogan’s podcast?—or figuring out what this means for America’s two political parties will take months, if not years. As you’ve heard on this podcast, I’m still arguing about what 2016 really meant on trade and immigration.My name’s Jerusalem Demsas, I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. As a disclaimer, I worked for the Harris primary campaign in 2019 before becoming a journalist, and my guest today, Tim Miller, is a political strategist who was Jeb Bush’s 2016 communications director on his presidential campaign. He’s been an anti-Trump conservative since then and is the host of The Bulwark Podcast.Today we’re going to talk through some of these inchoate narratives and debate which ones we think are likely to hold water.[Music]Demsas: Tim, welcome to the show.Tim Miller: Hey Jerusalem. What’s happening?Demsas: Well, we’re recording this six days after Election Day. And—as you have seen on Twitter, and I’m sure in your various interviews—the takes are already coming in very, very hot. And this is a show where we often look at narratives that have already baked, and kind of look at the research and data behind how these narratives formed and what truth is there and what sorts of things have gotten ahead of themselves.But we’re in an interesting moment right now where we’re seeing very important narrative formation happen in real time. In the aftermath of an election, everyone’s scrambling to define what happened in order to maybe wrest control of the future of the party from an ideological perspective or just a pure power perspective. And so we’re seeing a bunch of people arguing about why Trump won and why Harris lost in a time where there’s a bunch of unknowns. So we’re going to go through a few of these different narratives that are coming up.But Tim, right off the bat, I wanted to ask you: What’s your perception of why Trump won and Harris lost?Miller: I’m going to preempt my answer by saying that I think that uncertainty is important in this moment, and that false certainty can lead to some very mistaken and disastrous results. I say this from experience, having worked on the Republican autopsy in 2013, when the conventional wisdom congealed very quickly that Republicans, in order to win again, needed to moderate on immigration and cultural issues to appeal more to Hispanics and women. And not only was that wrong, but the person that became the nominee and then the president used that autopsy for toilet paper and went exactly the opposite direction.It also always didn’t also work out in Trump’s favor. In 2022, the conventional wisdom was that Trumpism was badly hurt and that Ron DeSantis was ascendant. Right? So anyway, in the week after the election, bad takes abound.Demsas: [Laughs.]Miller: That said, my answer is, I’m open to a variety of different things that the Democrats might have to do, among them being maybe nothing and watch Trump self-implode. Might be as simple as that. That said, the one thing that I think is certain that the Democrats need to reflect on when it comes to this question of why Trump won and why Harris lost—it’s that the Democratic message is not landing outside of a particular demographic of middle- to upper-income, college-educated, not particularly religious, urban- and suburban-dwelling white Americans, in addition to Black women, right? Those are the demos that the Democrats are doing well with, that Kamala Harris grew her share with from last time, at least in the case of college-educated women. And I think that the Democrats are doing a very poor job of communicating to people in all of those other demographics.On what they need to do, I’m very open to various possibilities about whether it’s about affect or vibe or policy or whatever. But I’m certain that there is—fair or unfair, there’s a perception that the Democrats don’t care about these other demographics, particularly working-class demographics, particularly working-class men. And that they did not offer them something that was more appealing than the nostalgia and promises of gold bullion that they got from Donald Trump. And so we can hash through all the different theories about why that was. But I think the fact that what happened—you can’t argue with.Demsas: Yeah. I think that that’s very descriptively true. But I guess what I would want to know from you is do you feel like there are specific things that Democrats have done that tipped the scales against them? I think that what you’re outlining here is very sound. There’s a difference between why Harris may have lost and what the Democrats need to do going forward to be a more electorally relevant party at the presidential level. And so from your perspective, though, is there something about the Democratic argument around the economy or other issues that you think was particularly relevant this time around?Miller: I think that, for starters, people were unhappy with the economy. And I don’t think that the Democrats presented a message to them about how they plan to change that for the better. But, again, I’m also not even really ready to concede that, with the exception of inflation being annoying and that broadly hurting people, the Democrats were hurt based on their economic argument. It might simply be cultural. It might be the way that they spoke, and having people feel like they weren’t being heard.I think the Democrats in particular—I always want to immediately go to, What is the policy prescription that would have appealed? And I’m like, It’s possible that there wasn’t one.Demsas: Yeah. An important backdrop that I think you’re alluding to here, as well, is that the inflationary environment was really, really bad for incumbents across the world, right? You’re kind of going into an election where the fundamentals are sort of rigged against incumbents because the inflationary episode was just really, really hard for people. I think one narrative that I’m seeing come up a lot is about campaign strategy. And this seems like something that’s going to be hashed out significantly. But I guess the question I have here is whether you think Harris could have won with a campaign run differently, even given the shortened timeline.Miller: I’m giving another “I don’t know” answer to that question: I don’t know. I think that she, by all accounts, ran a strong campaign that was based on her strengths. And I think she had an undeniably dominating debate performance. They ran a nice convention. Her speeches were good. The messaging pivot, the launch was good. There wasn’t a lot of drama inside the campaign, right? There are other things that she isn’t particularly strong at. I don’t think that she is that great in unscripted moments. Sometimes she’s better than others.And so then that’s the other thing that people come to, which is like, Oh, she should have done Rogan and all this. And I agree. I think she should have done more of those interviews, but they also weren’t really her strong suit. And I think that this was something that might’ve borne out had there been a longer primary, and maybe somebody else would have emerged. But that said, I don’t think so. I think Kamala Harris was going to emerge from a primary, no matter when Joe Biden dropped out.And so I’m not saying, Oh, this was inevitable. Just give up. Life is pain. [Laughs.] That’s not really what I’m saying. Any specific thing that people are like, Oh, if this tactic had been different, that would have helped—I don’t really buy that. I mean, I think that broadly speaking, her having the ability to separate herself from the administration would have been helpful, and I think that was very challenging to do given the situation Joe Biden left her in and the time period that was left. And I think that it’s very likely that she might have separated herself from the administration more and still lost, and we would have been here on this podcast with people saying, Why did she distance? [Laughs.] You know what I mean? Why did she break up the Democratic coalition?Demsas: Yeah. I mean, it’s funny. I think that, on the tactics, I’m sort of with you here. I was looking at some of the data analyses that are coming out now, and it looks like, at this point, given the data we have, while the national average from 2020 to 2024 shifts roughly six points, in battlegrounds, that number is going to end up closer to three points. And that speaks to campaign effects. That speaks to the fact that in battleground states where, again, the majority of the money is going, people are putting ads in battleground states, the campaign is putting rallies there, she’s visiting, they’re really working the press in those places to get her story and message out in a way that you’re not really going to do in a safe, Dem county in Illinois or something.And so as a result, what they see is that the campaign effects were good on a tactical level. Their ads were persuasive. There’s evidence from Dan Rosenhack at The Economist that it looks like the campaign effects were more effective than Trump’s on things like—indicating things like ads and rallies were better for Harris.I think on this kind of broader meta question that you kind of raised, right, about Harris as the nominee, I don’t think this is inevitable. I mean, I wrote an article on July 9th arguing that she was unlikely to be a good nominee and the party shouldn’t coronate her, and Nancy Pelosi to The New York Times—I don’t know if you saw this quote, after Harris’s loss—she says that she had expected that if the president were to step aside that there would be an open primary. And that maybe Kamala would have been stronger going forward if she’d gone through a primary and that the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, which made it impossible to have a primary at the time. But it sounds like you’re saying that you think that, regardless, this would not have really changed the game that much.Miller: Yeah, I mean, I think that had Joe Biden followed the—you can argue whether it was a promise or whether it was an indication that he was going to be a one-term [president] and pass the torch. And had there been a two-year process, maybe Kamala Harris does not emerge. But, look, there are three things that I think of when I hear this counterfactual about what would have happened had it been a more open process. The first thing is, the Democrat—one of the things that the Democrats have a lot of baggage around is identity politics. I think it would have been very challenging for a Black woman to be passed over.Demsas: But the Democratic primary voters did this in 2019, right? There was this argument being made, but they said, no, we care most about electability and they chose Joe Biden.Miller: Right, that’s true. But Joe Biden had been the vice president in that case. Kamala Harris was the vice president. You already saw this on social media. I saw this on social media, and I was basically for Kamala but also, at the same time, was like, maybe I think it’d be healthy to have an open process. And I guess if you could wave a magic wand, I probably would want Shapiro, Whitmer. Because hopefully that would win two of the three states you need to win the presidency. And that just seems like a safer bet to me. That was my position: It was like pro-Kamala and/but. And I had hundreds of people calling me a racist over that.So, I think that it would have caused a lot of turmoil within the party.Now, again, in a longer, two-year process, is that a lot of heat that then just dies out after a while, and you settle on something that’s a little bit more electable and everybody gets behind it except for a few people who have hurt feelings? Maybe.No. 2, an open process opens up Gaza [as a] wound and rips that apart even wider, and I think creates potentially even greater turmoil than she already was dealing with on that issue. And that’s cost her, frankly. And then No. 3 is then if the theory of the case is a more electable person with someone that could get more distance from the Biden-Harris administration, that assumes that the Democratic voters were looking for somebody to do that.And that is really where the tension is here, Jerusalem, because if you look at the data, a majority of the Biden-Harris Democrats were basically happy with the administration, right? There were surely big parts of the Democratic coalition, particularly younger voters, particularly working-class Black and Hispanic voters, the types of people that they lost ground with, that were unhappy with the Biden administration. But I think that there was a plurality within the party that was not going to be for somebody—look at the response to Dean Phillips, not exactly the most talented candidate, but total rejection and mockery for somebody who ran trying to get distance from the Biden-Harris administration.So I think it would have been very challenging to run as a candidate and get distance. So to me, it’s like if we lived in an imaginary world where identity politics wasn’t an issue, Gaza wasn’t an issue, and there was no backlash to distancing yourself from Biden, then certainly the Democrats could have come up with a stronger option.We don’t live in an imaginary world. And I think that within the world that we live in, within all those constraints, I think it’s very challenging to see a situation where you end up with somebody stronger than Harris.Demsas: Yeah, I mean, all those points I think are very well taken. And I think I’m seeing a lot of people make that argument of both Harris’s inevitability as the vice president, and also this sort of sense of It would have been a worse candidate. I do think that kind of my general belief is sort of, when you think you’re behind, you run a high-variance play. If you’re gonna lose anyway, you just kind of throw everything you can at the kitchen sink.And on this kind of inevitability point, right, I think there is this burgeoning sense that Democrats were just repudiated across the board here. You kind of brought this up, this idea that Democrats do not have a good answer on economic issues or on the issues that Americans care about.But I don’t know, how do you reconcile that with the clear ticket-splitting you see going on here? [Nebraska’s Dan] Osborne ran seven points ahead of the Harris ticket. [Montana Senator Jon] Tester ran seven points ahead of the ticket. Amy Klobuchar ran six points ahead. That’s just in the Senate. And in the House, we see over-performances from everyone from AOC to Jared Golden in Maine, who’s a much more moderate member of the Democratic coalition. Doesn’t that indicate at some level that candidate quality was important here and that there were other candidates that were much more electable?Miller: For starters, running the presidential race is so far different from running a Senate or House race that it’s almost not even the same sport.It’s literally like T-ball versus the major leagues. What people expect from their—I mean, nobody’s like, Oh man, does Amy Klobuchar have to go on Joe Rogan? Nobody watches Amy Klobuchar’s debates. Obviously it’s a little different in Montana, where you’re running a competitive race. But again, just the interest in Senate races is different. I think that the Democrats have a coalition that is perfectly durable and able to win nonpresidential elections. I think that this trade in the voters that has happened where the Democrats are picking up more high-trust, more middle- to high-income, more college-educated voters, and the Republicans are picking up more low-trust, more middle- to low-income, and less educated voters. As a trade, that accrues to Democrats benefits in off-year elections and midterms and special elections, just because it’s the type of person that shows up for those types of things, and it accrues to the Republicans benefit in presidential elections. So that’s not good when the Republicans are nominating Donald Trump, and the Republicans’ presidential nominee is an existential threat to the fabric of our republic. And so that’s a problem.And so I agree that you can’t look at the data and say, oh, the Democratic brand is irreparably harmed. Like, no, the Democrats won. And a lot of these Senate races are going to end up very narrow minorities, in the House and the Senate, that they will probably be able to win back in the midterms, depending on what happens.But I think that there are two things, which is, No. 1, the Democrats are not well suited to running presidential elections right now, in this media environment, and then No. 2 is that the Democrats have abandoned huge parts of the country where they are not viable. And that’s particularly problematic, given the Senate and Electoral College and the way that’s set up.So okay, back to No. 1. Democrats are really good at running campaigns that are set pieces. They have professionals that are running these campaigns: the ads, the conventions, the speeches, the going to the editorial-board meetings, the 2004-type campaigns. And that’s how Senate and House campaigns are basically still run in most of the country, and even governor’s races, right? People just don’t care about those races at that deep of a level. But the presidential race is—the media environment around it is so different. I mean, people are consuming information about the presidential race on their TikTok, listening to sports talk, listening to their random podcasts that aren’t about sports at all that are cultural, on women’s blogs, at a school function, people are talking about it casually, you know what I mean?I’m a parent, and obviously this is a little bit of selection bias since I’m in politics and people know that, but people don’t come up to me and ask me what I think about the House race in my district. Nobody’s mentioned Troy Carter to me at any events,, at any school functions or any of my kids’ sporting events.Demsas: He’s got to get his name out there. [Laughs.]Miller: And so the information environment is just a total category difference. And Trump and even J. D. Vance in certain ways were able to take advantage of that by running campaigns that are a little bit more unwieldy, that are better for viral clips, that are also better for sitting down for two hours and broing out with the Theo Von and talking about how you can’t even do coke in this country anymore because the fentanyl is in it, right?She wasn’t doing any of that. And doing one of those interviews isn’t really the answer, right? It’s like, can you communicate in a way that feels authentic? It might be fake authenticity, but in a way that feels authentic to people in their Instagram Stories, in their TikTok, in their podcasts, whatever.And Democrats are not producing a lot of candidates who I feel are good at that.Demsas: But I think there’s also this broad concern that the media ecosystem itself is not producing convincing, progressive-sounding or left-leaning media personalities. There’s a 2017 AER study that I remember being very, very shocking to people when it first came out, right after Trump’s election in 2016. And there are a couple economists, they look at the effect of Fox News, and they find that watching Fox News for an additional 2.5 minutes per week increases the vote share by 0.3 percentage points. But watching MSNBC has essentially no effect, and they see that Fox News is actually able to shift viewers’ attitudes rightward. And they look at 2004 and 2008 and find that Republican presidential candidates’ share of the two-party vote would have been more than three points lower in 2004, and six points lower in 2008 without Fox News.And so that’s something where I’m just like—there is something to the fact that the media ecosystem does not have that sort of targeted apparatus. But my usual belief about these sorts of things is that we’re discounting the fact that so much of the media is so liberal that Fox News can have this large effect because it I think stands out among a pack of more liberal institutions, but I am kind of surprised at MSNBC.Miller: Yeah, I mean, as a person on MSNBC, did that study go on before I was a political contributor? I think it did. So we might need to update the study and have them focus on my hits and see if that changes anything.I guess I want to noodle on that for a little bit. That does surprise me a little bit as well, but I would say this: I think that I’m less concerned. I think there’s a category of person out there, and maybe this is right, that is focused on Republicans have better propaganda outlets than the Democrats do.Demsas: Yeah.Miller: And maybe that’s true. I don’t know. So to me, then the question is, okay, what can be done? What is realistic in this media environment? And it goes back to this question of, can the Democrats speak more through using existing outlets or finding a candidate who has a compelling story in their own right, or compelling communication skills to figure out how to speak to people that don’t watch mainstream news?And that’s just really what it comes down to. The Democrats are very good at talking to people that are high-information, high-engagement, high-education, middle-to-high-income, and offering persuasive arguments. I think that they’re not good at talking to anybody else. And Obama was good at that, and Clinton was good at that. And we’re in a totally different media environment now than we were back then. But I think that there’s still things that can be learned from that.[Music]Demsas: After the break, why the abortion-ballot-measure strategy didn’t pan out for the Harris campaign.[Break]Demsas: I want to pull us out of this media conversation here, because I think that there’s also this, let’s say things go a little bit differently—and again, the margins here are not very big—and Harris has won.I think one of the big things we’d be hearing right now is that she won because of abortion, right? And looking at Election Night, you see a lot of wins for abortion. There are 10 states that have referendums on abortion policies, and seven of them win: New York, Maryland, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Missouri. And in Florida, where it loses, the threshold is 60 percent and it earns 57 percent, so it lost, but there’s clearly a majority in favor.And, going in, I mean, especially after the midterms, there was a real feeling, kind of the big narrative that came out of those midterms was that abortion is the place where Democrats can clearly distinguish and can clearly win over Republican candidates, even in deeply Republican states, and especially in deeply purple states.And I’m trying to think through this. What explains in your mind the sort of difference between how many voters were saying, Yes, I do have more liberal views on abortion; I’m willing to express those in these ballot measures; but no, I’m not going to then reward Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris for it?Miller: Well, a couple of things. No. 1, this tension has always existed as old as time, and it’s particularly existed as old as time in places like Florida. I did one of these, you know, time is a flat circle—Demsas: [Laughs.]Miller: I forget which election it was at this point, but it was like, how did the minimum-wage-increase ballot initiative in Florida pass at the same time that Ron DeSantis won by 18 points or whatever, whichever election that was.And it’s like, voters are complicated. Voters have complex views. And so you see this as kind of just a common thing in voter habits. In this case, I think that there are a couple of complicating factors in addition. No. 1 was, Donald Trump muddied the waters on his views.Demsas: Yeah.Miller: And I think that Donald Trump’s whole brand and vibe—I know we’re getting outside of the data space that you like to be in, Jerusalem, but there’s a certain group of people that are like, Yeah, that guy’s not gonna ban abortion. You know what I mean? And there’s just some percentage of voters out there that that’s just it. He doesn’t come off like Ted Cruz on abortion. He comes off as different, because they assume that he paid for an abortion or whatever, that he doesn’t care about it, and that he’s not gonna—this isn’t gonna be what he’s focused on. There are going to be people that are pro-choice that prioritize their economic views or their nativist views, right?So that is going to be some of it. I think less so in Florida, but more in Arizona. To me, I think that there is actually a strategic backfiring of having these ballot initiatives on the ballot almost gave some people an out to do both, right? People that did not like Kamala Harris or that were more center-right and said, Oh, okay, great, I can protect abortion in Arizona and also vote for Donald Trump. I can have my cake and eat it, too.Demsas: Yeah, I mean, I think my read of it is more that when you think about the specific argument being made about abortion, it was largely, he’s to blame for all these horrible things that are happening to women in states that have made abortion inaccessible. And by he, I mean Trump is to blame for that. And also, you know, he appointed these Supreme Court nominees who overturned Roe v. Wade. But as a prescription for the future, I feel like there was not a real clear argument made to voters of how Kamala Harris is going to actually protect abortion.But again, it all comes back to the overarching question, did voters view this as an abortion election? And it seems clear that they viewed it as an inflation election. That was the core thing that they were focused on. And I think that one thing that I’ve heard a lot is what this means for understanding America, right?So after 2016, people were just, I think, in shock, and were saying, I can’t believe this is the country I live in. And again here I’m hearing the sort of question of, you know, this is a black mark on the conscience of America, that people would vote for someone who threatened to overturn the results of the 2020 election, who talks with such liberal disdain for women and immigrants.Something someone said to me in 2016 was really interesting: If your entire perception of America would have shifted if a few hundred thousand people voted differently, maybe don’t completely change everything you believe about everyone. And to me, I think that this framing about Trump’s reelection means something really dark about all the people that voted for him doesn’t really sit well with me because it seems like people are voting based on cost of living. At the same time, too, I think they’re taking their signal from Democrats who, if they’d taken their own warnings about the threat of fascism or the threat to our institutions, I think would have behaved very differently over the past couple of years in trying to win.Miller: Yeah. It doesn’t change my view of the American people, really, that there are good people and bad people everywhere, that we all have good and bad inside of us. I’ll say that what it does impact for me—and maybe this is wrong and maybe I’m raw and it’s six days out—but for those of us who do have a belief that there’s something kind of special about the American system and that have revered America, that understand that America is flawed and has made mistakes but still is a unique experiment in the world. You know, the “America is an idea” type of thing.The idea is pretty dim at this point. And, to me, that is the change, having him win again, that I’m having trouble getting over. Mentally, it’s not that it makes me look poorly at my neighbors, but that we just might be at the end of the experiment and the sense that America is something different than Hungary or Switzerland or whatever, any country—you name the country.It was the old fight with Republicans and Democrats during the Obama years, which is, Obama doesn’t think of America as any different than Belgium. Obama believes in Belgian exceptionalism. And that to me is kind of where I am. I think that we’re about to move into an era where America’s flaws, in addition to all of our existing flaws like gun violence and our history of racism, et cetera—the American system’s flaws look a lot more like what flaws look like in other countries.There’s going to be oligarchy, kleptocracy, corruption. There’s no special sense that the huddled masses around the world are welcome here any more than they might be welcome anywhere else. They frankly are probably going to be welcome here less than they’re welcome in certain other places.And so to me, that is what I see differently. I reserve the right to change my mind about that at some point, but that’s where I’m at right now.Demsas: Yeah. I think in contrast to this large view about the American idea of maybe being different than we believed beforehand is this, I think, really popular take that’s picking up steam, which is about just Democrats need to moderate on cultural issues, whether it’s about immigration, or it’s the issue of trans women and girls in sports. They’re just too left of the median voter, and you don’t actually need to do a bunch else other than accept that people are where they are on those places and not go so far away from it.The data point that’s kind of in favor of this, particularly on the trans-girls-in-sports one, is Kamala Harris’s leading super PAC, Future Forward, finds that the most effective, or one of the most effective, Trump ads is one of the “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you” ads. They find that it shifted the race 2.7 percentage points in Trump’s favor after people watched it.How relevant do you think that the Democratic Party’s leftward shift on cultural issues is to Harris’s loss? And I mean, there’s some people who I think are really making the claim that you could just really focus on this and you don’t need to make these kind of larger arguments about strategy or how we’re speaking to America on economic policy.Miller: I don’t think that this was alone to account for Harris’s loss or even maybe the biggest thing to account for her loss. I think that she didn’t really respond to that ad in particular quite well, and that maybe that was a strategic mistake. I think her campaign—and she didn’t run like an overly “woke,” culturally left campaign. Ao the question is, did the Democratic brand on those issues drag her down? I think possibly.To me, look, could Kamala Harris have squeaked out a victory this time while holding the same positions on trans issues had inflation been 20 percent better? Maybe. Probably. It was a clear victory for Trump, but it wasn’t, you know, Reagan ’84.A couple of things changed, and had that one, the cultural stuff stayed static, could she have still won? Clearly. I mean, Biden won in 2020, when all of those issues were more high-salience, I think, than they were this time. Biden, not a Black woman—so maybe there’s something to that as well, that he was able to be a little bit more resilient against attacks on those issues.So maybe that’s worth thinking about. I would say this, though. If the Democrats want to have 60 senators again ever, then yeah, they got to moderate on cultural issues. You know what I mean? There are two ways to look at this: Can Democrats still win elections by maintaining their views on everything? Yes. Are the Democrats giving away huge swaths of the country by not really even engaging with their concerns about the leftward shift of the party on a wide array of issues? Yeah, they are. I get the land-doesn’t-vote thing, I get it, but look at the map.Demsas: [Laughs.] We’ve all seen the map.Miller: The map is still the map, you know what I mean?And Trump gained in all of those little red counties out there where it’s just land, all right? But he gained. There are a handful of people out there, and he got more of them, in every county. And the Democrats’, I think, choice to just say, Well, we’re just giving up on that and we’re just going to focus on the more dynamic parts of the growing parts of the country and, eventually, demographics are destiny and blah, blah, blah, that looks like a pretty bad bet today.I’m not out here being like, yeah, you got to throw trans people or migrants under the bus for them to win. But certainly the cultural leftward shift has created a ceiling on Democratic support that I think has a negative effect for the party, but also for progress on a lot of those issues.Demsas: Yeah. I think it’s obviously very up in the air here, how people are gonna take this mantle of how you should moderate, and I think that there’s bad and good ways that people can take this. And I think that there’s a level to which people—you don’t have to be throwing trans people under the bus. Maybe we need to figure out ways, whether it’s how Democrats responded to this with gay rights, where they talked about federalism a lot and made sure the country moved toward the issue before making it a national issue.But I think the most important and damning thing that Democrats are clearly responsible for in the choices they have made is about the poor governance in blue cities and states. This is one of my hobbyhorses, but you see massive shifts, as you mentioned, in high-cost-of-living places that are heavily democratic, in New York and in California and in a lot of the Northeast. And I think it’s hard to see that as anything other than just a repudiation of Democratic governance and particularly the cost of living and the cost of housing in these places.And so, to me, when you talked about the Democratic brand, I mean, when you’re in a cost-of-living election, yes, there are marginal effects on these cultural issues we’re talking about here. Yes, there are things that campaigns can do better. Yes, there are candidate effects. But if people are asking themselves, What does it look like, how does it feel to my pocketbook to live in a Democratically run state versus a Republican one? I feel like they’re being told a very clear story.Miller: I think that that’s true. I’ve been ruminating on this a lot over the past week. I live in Louisiana, so there is the kind of emotional guttural response I have to this, which is, do you think Louisiana is being governed that well? Because I don’t.Demsas: Yeah. Well, on cost, though, right? It’s cheaper, obviously, to have a house in Louisiana.Miller: It’s cheaper to have a house in Louisiana because of the economic destruction of the state over the past couple of decades and the fact that everybody that grows up in parts of the state that’s not this corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge leave home. And a lot of people in these places leave home, too, looking for better economic opportunities. And that’s sad for the state.That is my initial response, which is emotional, which is like, okay, sure. But why does Kamala Harris have to carry the baggage for the place I used to live—Oakland—but Donald Trump doesn’t have to carry the baggage for the hollowing out of big parts of Louisiana? That said, it’s true that it hurt the Democrats, right? And it’s also true that the Democrats have been badly managing these big cities. And if you just look at the numbers, suburban Democrats—and this could be a counterargument. Now, I’m going to really give you a galaxy brain, Jerusalem, to your original data point earlier that the three-point effect in the battleground states versus national speaks to a campaign effect? Maybe.Maybe it also speaks to the fact that a lot of these battleground states are made up of places that have mixed governance and big suburbs where the Democrats are doing better. Democrats are doing better in suburban America because they know they’re not feeling the acute pain of governing issues that have plagued a lot of the big cities. And surely there are a couple of big cities in those seven swing states, but none of the ones you think of when you think of major disruptions, and that maybe that explains it and that the Republican gains were in a lot more of those places like that, Illinois, New Jersey, California. Anyway, just something to noodle on.But I think that it is objectively true that Democrats are doing better in places that have not been plagued by some of these bad governing decisions on crime and on housing that we’ve seen for in Democratic cities, and the Democratic mayors and Democratic governors in blue states should fix that.And it’s the No. 1 thing—the last thing I’ll say on this is—the No. 1 thing that comes to mind when I already hear stupid parlor-game stuff about 2028 and it’s like Gavin Newsom and J. B. Pritzker. And to me, the No. 1 thing Gavin Newsom and J. B. Pritzker need to do if they want to run in 2027 is make Illinois and California run better in the meantime. Otherwise, nothing against either of those two guys, but I think that they’re going to carry this baggage that you’re talking about.Demsas: Well, I could go on about housing in blue states forever. And there’s an article popping, I think today, listeners, as you’re hearing about this, about why I think this was a big issue for the election.But Tim, always our last and final question.Miller: Okay.Miller: What is something that you once thought was a good idea but ended up only being good on paper?Miller: Oh, okay. Hold on. I wasn’t prepared for this. I misread the question. I thought it was an idea that was only good on paper that then ended up being not good on paper.Demsas: Idea could be good.Miller: No, no, no. I’ll come up with one where I’m wrong. I’m happy to bet where I’m wrong. I was just saying the ideas are endless on those.Demsas: Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something that you held, yeah, yeah, yeah.Miller: An idea that I thought that was good on paper that ended up not being good on paper. Well, I guess I have to give the obvious answer to that question, sadly. I don’t get to rant about daylight savings time as I hoped to—an idea that was certainly good on paper in the 1800s or whenever they came up with it that’s no longer good. Falling back, that is. Permanent daylight saving time: good idea.Changing times: not good.Demsas: Four hundred electoral votes for whoever does this.Miller: Yeah. The idea that I thought that was good on paper that is relevant to this podcast—because I literally put it on paper and wrote it—was the aforementioned 2013 GOP autopsy.Demsas: Oh, yeah.Miller: Well, how great! Compassionate conservatism. Republicans can diversify their party by getting softer on cultural issues and reaching out to the suburbs and reaching out to Hispanic voters and Black voters, criminal-justice reform, and that through criminal-justice reform and immigration reform and softening on gays, that Republicans can have a new, diverse electorate, and we can all move into a happy, bipartisan future.That was a great idea on paper that backfired spectacularly, and now the Republicans have their most diverse electorate that they’ve had ever, I think, voting for Donald Trump after rejecting all of those suggestions that I put on paper. So there you go.Demsas: As one vote of confidence for younger Tim, there are very many ways that history could have gone. I think that people often forget how contingent things are and how unique of a figure Trump is. And right now we’ve talked through a bunch of different ways that people are reading this moment, but there are a lot of ways that people can go, depending on what candidates do and say and how they catch fire and their charisma and what ends up being relevant in two years and in four years. So a little bit of sympathy for younger Tim.Miller: I appreciate that. And that is true. Who the hell knows, right?Demsas: Yeah, exactly.Miller: Had Donald Trump not run that time and he decided he wanted to do some other scam instead, then maybe Marco Rubio is the nominee and those things do come to pass.Demsas: [Laughs.] Yeah. If Obama doesn’t make fun of him at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, we’re not even sitting here on this podcast.Miller: Great job, Jon Lovett, or whoever wrote that joke.Demsas: [Laughs.]Miller: I’m just joking.Demsas: Yeah. Well, thank you so much, Tim. Thanks for coming on the show.Miller: Thank you, Jerusalem.[Music]Demsas: Good on Paper is produced by Jinae West.

CONTENT: For the growing number of African asylum seekers and economic migrants in the US, the upcoming presidential election could reshape their entire future.“We deserve safety,” says Dr Yves Kaduli, a 38-year-old asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who lives in the US."I have a dream that I will defend those that are persecuted," he adds in a BBC interview.Dr Kaduli says that in 2014, he fled eastern DR Congo - which has been wracked by conflict for almost three decades - after being kidnapped and tortured.He had been working as a doctor at Cifunzi Hospital in Kalonge town and saw the effects of the conflict up-close.“Women were raped. I saw it. I felt it in my body," he tells the BBC.Dr Kaduli says that horrified at the civilian casualties, he and many of his colleagues, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Denis Mukwege, participated in protests against the killings and rapes by armed groups, criticising then-President Joseph Kabila's government for its failure to guarantee the safety of people.The medic says this led to him being targeted by unknown men.“They came, they took me and another colleague by force during our night shift,” Dr Kaduli recalls, adding that they were then taken to a makeshift camp in a nearby forest where they were beaten, tortured and threatened with death.Dr Kaduli says that after being held for a day he managed to escape and decided he had to get out.Leaving his mother and young son behind, Dr Kaduli says he began what would be a five-year journey, passing first through neighbouring Rwanda, then flying to Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and finally arriving at the US-Mexico border in 2019.“I remained on the border for at least a month, we were living in small tents in inhumane conditions.”Dr Kaduli says he then succeeded in crossing into the US and was detained for 15 months, before being released.He now lives in Virginia working as a medical technician, awaiting a decision on his asylum case.Dr Kaduli is one of thousands of African migrants who against all odds complete the long journey to reach the US-Mexico border each year. It is a number that is rising.But with many Americans saying immigration is a top concern in this election, and both candidates promising to crack down at the border, African asylum seekers are worried the public may turn against them.“We see our politicians criminalise our status, demonise our community and being a president, they can decide our future,” Dr Kaduli tells the BBC.In 2022, around 13,000 African migrants were recorded at the US-Mexico border, according to US Customs and Border protection data. By 2023, this figure had quadrupled to 58,000.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports a sharp increase in asylum applications from West African countries such as Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea since 2022 at the same border.New asylum applications from Senegalese nationals alone jumped from 773 in 2022, to 13,224 in 2024.Although relatively stable, more than one third of the population in Senegal live in poverty, according to the World Bank.A growing number of young Senegalese choose to migrate to the US rather than face the more dangerous route to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.They are opting for an increasingly popular route - which is being shared through social media, including TikTok - through visa-friendly Nicaragua.In September 2023, more than 140 Senegalese people were deported back home after crossing the Mexico-US border.People are coming to the US for mixed reasons, says Kathleen Bush-Joseph from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think-tank funded by research grants and foundations."People can be fleeing persecution and fleeing economic circumstances that make it difficult to feed their children. There are incentives to apply for asylum because they can get a work permit while they wait and that can really create a draw for people seeking to improve their lives," she says.Successfully claiming asylum in the US is particularly challenging for African migrants.Language barriers, a lack of community upon arrival and a lack of awareness of African conflicts make the stringent process even harder for Africans, says Ms Bush-Joseph.“Judges and attorneys are often not familiar with the situations in some of the African countries that people are fleeing,” she tells the BBC.There are also risks for those who are deported.In 2022, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report alleging that dozens of asylum seekers from Cameroon were imprisoned, tortured and raped after being sent back from the US border.“People were deported directly back to harm and persecution and in contexts where there are ongoing conflicts and wide-spread human rights violations,” HRW researcher Lauren Seigbert tells the BBC.“It’s just a huge risk to send people back,” she adds.Nils Kinuani, a federal policy manager at African Communities Together, an organisation that supports African asylum seekers and refugees in the US, says rhetoric around immigration in the election campaign has caused “great fear” among his community.“People are fearful. There are concerns that refugee programmes could come under attack,” Mr Kinuani says.His organisation and others are calling for more legal routes to help African migrants who are terrified of deportation.One option is humanitarian parole status, a legal protection for foreign nationals from countries facing crises such as conflicts or natural disasters.It can be issued by the US government to allow people at risk to live and work in the US temporarily - current programmes include Ukraine, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Afghanistan.There are no official humanitarian parole programmes in place between the US and any African country.Mr Kinuani adds that there is some resentment over the way that refugees from Ukraine have been treated, compared to other nationalities.Just a few weeks after the war broke out in Ukraine, nationals fleeing the conflict were eligible to apply for humanitarian parole, he says.“Ukrainian communities didn’t even need to ask or advocate for humanitarian parole. For a country like Sudan, we have to push.”Since April 2023, the ongoing war in Sudan has forced nine million people from their homes.Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have put controlling immigration and solving the US-Mexico border crisis high up on their list of campaign promises.If elected, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump would carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history” and reinstate border policies reminiscent of his first term in office, according to the official Republican National Committee’s 2024 Platform.Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate and Vice-President Kamala Harris has promised to revive a bipartisan border security bill that failed in Congress earlier this year.The bill would “increase asylum staffing” and ensure a “faster and fairer” asylum process, according to the White House.But it has received criticism from human rights groups and the UN.The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden - of which Harris is a part - has already moved to crack down on migrants at the border.Under an executive order issued in June, officials can quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests once a daily threshold is met and the border is "overwhelmed".This has led to a sharp decline in the number of people trying to enter the US through the border, according to US officials.For the first time in almost two decades more than half of Americans want immigration levels to the US cut, rather than kept at their present level or increased, recent polling from global analytics and advisory firm Gallup suggests.“In the US there is an increasing awareness that the asylum system is so overwhelmed and people are making claims because there aren’t other ways to come to the United States,” says Ms Bush-Joseph.“Frustration that people have about the dysfunction of the US immigration system does mean that there is concern about the number of people claiming asylum."For now, Dr Kaduli is stuck in limbo and could be left waiting four to 10 years for a decision on his asylum application.He says that a couple of years ago, his father passed away, but his current status does not allow him to leave the country to see his family.“I feel uncomfortable when my case is still pending and I see on the television the speech of politicians, but I know if I’m here it’s for a reason,” he says.His ultimate hope is that one day his son and mother will join him in the US.“I believe that America will give me the same values, to work for myself, to help my family, to participate in the economy of this country, so I’m between doubt and hope.”North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Rumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election.Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats.The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process.The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.Many posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign’s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November.When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a "fair and legal and good election".A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday.Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state.“Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network. “REPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!”The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud.While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of "half-truths" and disinformation circulating on social media.“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” he said.The BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each.The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process.One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia.The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by "Russian influence actors".Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: “Figured I would drive across the border and vote."It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border.Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.Experts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond.It's happened before.In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. "Stop the steal" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results.On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats.While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day.Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists “are preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren’t in 2020”.“We cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,” she said.These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning.“I feel very confident about Trump, as long as there’s no cheating,” said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he’d already heard rumours about fraud. “Our only hope is that it’s not big enough to change the result.”After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.Experts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters.But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating.In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud.“They WILL cheat,” says one of the thousands of comments posted.As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards.But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to “rig” the election.“Look at this new cheat voter fraud,” read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. “Dems already doing their best to steal another election.”The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say.“These incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,” said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations.Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security.On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities.They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure.“Our hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,” said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters.But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale.“If they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they’re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,” she added.The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment.A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities.Elon Musk’s America political action committee has started a community – akin to a message board – on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock.Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers – partisan observers who attend polling places.The volume of messages on these platforms – along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources – makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation.The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.The effect of this is unpredictable.The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC’s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists.And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner.Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an “ecosystem of distrust”.But despite the doubts being sown, he says, “accurate information is getting out there".“Election officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,” Mr Lozada said. “That’s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.”With reporting by BBC VerifyAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: For much of the 2024 US presidential campaign, polls and pundits rated the race too close to call.Then Donald Trump delivered a commanding victory over Kamala Harris, winning at least five battleground states, and performing unexpectedly well in other places.He is now poised to become the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, and could enter office with a Republican-controlled House and Senate at his back.So were the polls wrong about it being a tight contest?At the national level, they certainly appeared to underestimate Trump for the third election in a row.But in the battleground states such as Pennsylvania, where most of the polling was focused, Trump's margin of victory was typically within striking distance of his performance in the polls, even if the forecasts were slightly lower than the final outcome.The average polling error seen in these swing states was not actually that big. Still, in tight campaigns, small changes can make a big difference.Ahead of the results, media outlets including the BBC warned that despite the close race in the polls, it could end up looking like a landslide for either candidate, given the margin of error.In some less closely-watched parts of the US, polls underestimated Trump's support more significantly - a sign of some blind spots, said Michael Bailey, a professor at Georgetown University and author of the book Polling at a Crossroads."At a glance, in the battleground states, polls ran a little hot for Harris but really not so bad, but when you dig deeper, it's all a little less impressive," he said.In Florida, for example, polls tracked by RealClearPolitics in the final weeks of the election put Trump ahead by about five points. He won by a greater margin of 13.In New Jersey, Harris was expected to win by nearly 20 percentage points, based on the two most recent polls tracked by the site. Her margin was more slender, closer to 10."Just imagine if we knew that or had a better sense of that a month ago. I don't know that it would change the election but it would certainly change our expectations," Prof Bailey said.He said pollsters this year may have leaned too heavily on bets that people would behave roughly as they did in 2020 - failing to anticipate the depth of the swing among Latino and young voters toward Trump."These models that assume so heavily that we're going to get a repeat... they're a disaster when there's a big change," he said.But pollster Nate Silver, founder of the 538 polling analysis site, said there were signs of peril for those who were looking.Writing about the election results, he noted a poll from New York City last month, which indicated Trump making major inroads in the traditional Democratic stronghold."This is a problem the party should have been prepared for, because there was plenty of evidence for it in polls and election data," he wrote.Debate about the polls is sure to continue in the months ahead.That is particularly true in a year in which figures like Trump and billionaire supporter Elon Musk have promoted betting markets - many of which did forecast a decisive Trump victory - as a more accurate alternative.Experts said the polling profession does face challenges.Response rates to surveys have plunged, as it becomes easier for people to screen calls from unknown numbers.The fall has also coincided with rising distrust of media and institutions - a feature particularly pronounced among Trump supporters that some argue has led to their under-representation.Prof Bailey said the big miss in the much-discussed poll of Iowa by Ann Selzer - that was released days ahead of the election and indicated a three-point lead for Harris in the state - showed the risks of the traditional approach.To make up for such issues, many of the most high-profile polls now function more like models, with firms weighting responses from different groups and making other assumptions about factors such as turnout.Many pollsters have also shifted to using online surveys, but experts said those were known for being unreliable.This year, voters who were inclined to fill out online polls were more likely to be Democrats, James Johnson of London-based polling firm JL Partners told the Times of London newspaper. They were "more likely to be young, they’re more likely to be highly-engaged, they’re more likely to be working from home," he said.Prof Bailey said pollsters had to "move on" from random samples and get comfortable with modelling, while doing a better job testing and explaining their assumptions.But Prof Jon Krosnick of Stanford University said without truly random samples, surveys would remain vulnerable to error.Pollsters are "trying hard but they keep trying to be too clever," he said. "What we need to do is go back to basics and spend the time and money that it takes to do polls accurately."North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: The party went into an election with policies it couldn’t defend—or even explain.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.One of the mysteries of this election is how the Democrats approached polling day with a set of policies on gender identity that they were neither proud to champion—nor prepared to disown.Although most Americans agree that transgender people should not face discrimination in housing and employment, there is nowhere near the same level of support for allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports—which is why Donald Trump kept bringing up the issue. His campaign also barraged swing-state voters and sports fans with ads reminding them that Kamala Harris had previously supported taxpayer-funded gender-reassignment surgery for prisoners. The commercials were effective: The New York Times reported that Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, found that one ad “shifted the race 2.7 percentage points in Mr. Trump’s favor after viewers watched it.” The Harris campaign mostly avoided the subject.Since the election, reports of dissent from this strategy have begun to trickle out. Bill Clinton reportedly raised the alarm about letting the attacks go unanswered, but was ignored. After Harris’s loss, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts went on the record with his concerns. “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,” he told the Times. The recriminations go as far as the White House, where allies of Joe Biden told my colleague Franklin Foer that the current president would have countered Trump’s ads more aggressively, and “clearly rejected the idea of trans women competing in women’s sports.”One problem: Biden’s administration has long pushed the new orthodoxy on gender, without ever really explaining to the American people why it matters—or, more crucially, what it actually involves. His officials have advocated for removing lower age limits for gender surgeries for minors, and in January 2022, his nominee for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, refused to define the word woman, telling Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, “I’m not a biologist.”Thomas Chatterton Williams: What the left keeps getting wrongOn sports—an issue seized on by the Trump campaign—Biden’s White House has consistently prioritized gender identity over sex. Last year, the Department of Education proposed regulations establishing “that policies violate Title IX when they categorically ban transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity just because of who they are.” Schools were, however, allowed to limit participation in specific situations. (In April, with the election looming, this part of the Title IX revision was put on hold.) Harris went into the campaign tied to the Biden administration’s positions, and did not have the courage, or strategic sense, to reject them publicly. Nor did she defend them.The fundamental issue is that athletes who have gone through male puberty are typically stronger and faster than biological females. Rather than contend with that fact, many on the left have retreated to a comfort zone of claiming that opposition to trans women in women’s sports is driven principally by transphobia. But it isn’t: When trans men or nonbinary people who were born female have competed in women’s sports against other biological females, no one has objected. The same season that Lia Thomas, a trans woman, caused controversy by swimming in the women’s division, a trans man named Iszac Henig did so without any protests. (He was not taking testosterone and so did not have an unfair advantage.) Yet even talking about this issue in language that regular Americans can understand is difficult: On CNN Friday, when the conservative political strategist Shermichael Singleton said that “there are a lot of families out there who don’t believe that boys should play girls’ sports,” he was immediately shouted down by another panelist, Jay Michaelson, who said that the word boy was a “slur,” and he “was not going to listen to transphobia at this table.” The moderator, Abby Phillips, also rebuked Singleton, telling him to “talk about this in a way that is respectful.”A few Democrats, such as Colin Allred, a Senate candidate in Texas, attempted to counter Republicans’ ads by forcefully supporting women’s right to compete in single-sex sports—and not only lost their races anyway, but were attacked from the left for doing so. In states such as Texas and Missouri, the political right is surveilling and threatening to prosecute parents whose children seek medical treatments for gender dysphoria, or restricting transgender adults’ access to Medicaid. In this climate, activists believe, the Democrats should not further jeopardize the rights of a vulnerable minority by legitimizing voters’ concerns. “Please do not blame trans issues or trans people for why we lost,” Sam Alleman, the Harris campaign’s LBGTQ-engagement director, wrote on X. “Trans folks have been and are going to be a primary target of Project 2025 and need us to have their backs now more than ever.”During the race, many journalists wrote about the ubiquity—and the grimness—of the Trump ads on trans issues, notably Semafor’s David Weigel. But at the time, I was surprised how dismissive many commentators were about their potential effect, given the enormous sums of money involved. My theory was that these ads tapped into a larger concern about Democrats: that they were elitists who ruled by fiat, declined to defend their unpopular positions, and treated skeptics as bigots. Gender might not have been high on voters’ list of concerns, but immigration and the border were—and all the same criticisms of Democratic messaging apply to those subjects, too.Not wishing to engage in a losing issue, Harris eventually noted blandly that the Democrats were following the law on providing medical care to inmates, as Trump had done during his own time in office. On the integrity of women’s sports, she said nothing.Read: Why Biden’s team thinks Harris lostHow did we get here? At the end of Barack Obama’s second term, gay marriage was extended to all 50 states, an achievement for which LGBTQ groups had spent decades campaigning. In 2020, the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County found that, in the words of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, “an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.” Those advances meant that activist organizations, with large staffs and existing donor networks, had to go looking for the next big progressive cause. Since Trump came to power, they have stayed relevant and well funded by taking maximalist positions on gender—partly in reaction to divisive red-state laws, such as complete bans on gender medicine for minors. The ACLU, GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign, and other similar groups have done so safe in the knowledge that they answer to their (mostly wealthy, well-educated) donors, rather than a more diverse and skeptical electorate. “The fundamental lesson I hope Dem politicians take from this election is that they should not adopt positions unless they can defend them, honestly, in a one-on-one conversation with the median American voter, who is a white, non-college 50-yr-old living in a small-city suburb,” the author (and Atlantic contributing writer) James Surowiecki argued last week on X.Even now, though, many Democrats are reluctant to discuss the party’s positions on trans issues. The day after Moulton made his comments, his campaign manager resigned in protest, and the Massachusetts state-party chair weighed in to say that they “do not represent the broad view of our party.” But Moulton did not back down, saying in a statement that although he had been accused of failing “the unspoken Democratic Party purity test,” he was committed to defending the rights of all Americans. “We did not lose the 2024 election because of any trans person or issue. We lost, in part, because we shame and belittle too many opinions held by too many voters and that needs to stop.”Gilberto Hinojosa, the chair of the Texas Democrats, faced a similar backlash. He initially told reporters, “There’s certain things that we just go too far on, that a big bulk of our population does not support,” but he quickly walked back the comments. “I extend my sincerest apologies to those I hurt with my comments today,” Hinojosa said. “In frustration over the GOP’s lies to incite hate for trans communities, I failed to communicate my thoughts with care and clarity.” (On Friday, he resigned, citing the party’s “devastating” election results in the state.)The tragedy of this subject is that compromise positions are available that would please most voters, and would stop a wider backlash against gender nonconformity that manifests as punitive laws in red states. America is a more open-minded country than its toughest critics believe—the latest research shows that about as many people believe that society has not gone far enough in accepting trans people as think that it has gone too far. Delaware has just elected the first transgender member of Congress, Sarah McBride. But most voters think that biological sex is real, and that it matters in law and policy. Instructing them to believe otherwise, and not to ask any questions, is a doomed strategy. By shedding their most extreme positions, the Democrats will be better placed to defend transgender Americans who want to live their lives in peace.More StoriesHow One Woman Became the Scapegoat for America’s Reading CrisisDonald Trump’s Latest Violent Fantasy

CONTENT: Two key components of a contentious presidential election are speaking loudly to the present.Americans are headed to the polls today to cast their ballots in a crucial election. People are anxious, hopeful, and scared about the stakes of the election and its aftermath. But this is not the only such electoral test that American democracy has faced. An earlier contest has much to say to the present.The presidential election of 1800 was a crisis of the first order, featuring extreme polarization, wild accusations, and name-calling—the Federalist John Adams was labeled “hermaphroditical” by Republicans, and, in turn, Federalists warned that Thomas Jefferson would destroy Christianity. People in two states began stockpiling arms to take the government for Jefferson if necessary, seeing him as the intended winner. Federalist members of Congress considered overturning the election; thousands of people surrounded the Capitol to learn the outcome; and an extended, agonizing tie between Jefferson and Aaron Burr took 36 votes to resolve in the House of Representatives.We’re not looking at a replay of the 1800 election; history doesn’t repeat itself. But two key components of that electoral firestorm are speaking loudly to the present: the threat of violence and the proposed solution to the electoral turmoil after the contest’s close.The unfortunate truth is that democratic governance is often violent. When the promises and reach of democracy expand, it almost always brings an antidemocratic blowback, sometimes including threats and violence. Black men gaining the right to vote during the Civil War was met with bluntly hostile threats, intimidation, and voter suppression during Reconstruction. The advancing demands for the civil rights of Black Americans in the 1960s led to vicious beatings and murders. In both eras, white Americans who felt entitled to power—and who felt threatened by the expanding rights and opportunities granted to racial minorities through democratic means—resorted to violence.Elaine Godfrey: The real election risk comes laterAt the end of the 18th century, the Federalists were the party of extreme entitlement. They favored a strong central government with the power to enforce its precepts and were none too comfortable with a democratic politics of resistance, protest, and pushback. They wanted Americans to vote for their preferred candidates, then step aside and let their betters govern.When Jefferson and Burr—both Democratic Republicans—received an equal number of electoral votes, the Federalists were horrified. They faced the nightmare choice between Jefferson, a Republican notoriously opposed to the Federalists, or Burr, an unpredictable and opportunistic politico with unknown loyalties. They largely preferred Burr, who seemed far more likely to compromise with the Federalists.Tied elections are thrown to the House of Representatives to decide, with each state getting one vote. Given this chance to steal the election, Federalists inside and outside Congress began plotting—perhaps they could prevent the election of either candidate and elect a president pro tem until they devised a better solution.Federalist talk of intervention didn’t go unnoticed. Governors in Pennsylvania and Virginia began to stockpile arms in case the government needed to be taken for Jefferson. This was no subversive effort; Jefferson himself knew of their efforts, telling James Madison and James Monroe that the threat of resistance “by arms” was giving the Federalists pause. “We thought it best to declare openly & firmly, one & all, that the day such an act [of usurpation] passed the middle states would arm.”Ultimately, there was no violence. But the threat was very real—a product of the fact that Federalists felt so entitled to political power that they were unwilling to lose by democratic means. And losing is a key component of democracy. Elections are contests with winners and losers. Democracy relies on these free and fair contests to assign power according to the preferences of the American people. People who feel entitled to power are hostile to these contests. They won’t accept unknown outcomes. They want inevitability, invulnerability, and immunity, so they strike out at structures of democracy. They scorn electoral proceedings, manipulate the political process, and threaten their opponents. Sometimes, the end result is violence. In the election of 2024, this is the posture adopted by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. As in 1800, a steadfast sense of entitlement to power is threatening our democratic process.The election of 1800 was just the fourth presidential contest in American history, and only the election of 1796, the first without George Washington as a candidate, had been contested. After the crisis of 1800, some people sought better options. At least one Federalist favored ending popular presidential elections altogether. Thinking back to the election a few years later, the Connecticut Federalist James Hillhouse proposed amending the constitutional mode of electing presidents. The president should be chosen from among acting senators, he suggested. A box could be filled with balls—most of them white, one of them colored—and each senator who was qualified for the presidency would proceed in alphabetical order and pull a ball from the box. The senator who drew the colored ball would be president. Chief Justice John Marshall, who agreed that presidential contests were dangerous, declared the plan as good as any other.Most people didn’t go that far, but Federalists and Republicans alike understood that the threat posed by fiercely contested partisan elections could be dire. Although the presidency had been peacefully transferred from one party to another, the road to that transfer had been rocky. Stockpiling arms? Threats of armed resistance? Seizing the presidency? The entire nation rocked by political passions, seemingly torn in two?One Republican asked Jefferson in March 1801: What would have happened if there had been the “non election of a president”? Jefferson’s response is noteworthy. In that case, he wrote, “the federal government would have been in the situation of a clock or watch run down … A convention, invited by the republican members of Congress … would have been on the ground in 8 weeks, would have repaired the constitution where it was defective, and wound it up again.”The political process would save the nation. A convention. Perhaps amending the Constitution. The solution to the crisis, Jefferson argued, lay in tried-and-true constitutional processes of government. As he put it, they were a “peaceable & legitimate resource, to which we are in the habit of implicit obedience.”David A. Graham: How is it this close?And indeed, that is the purpose of the Constitution, a road map of political processes. As Americans, we agree to abide by its standards or use constitutional and legal political means to change them. When people attack the Constitution—threaten it, ignore it, violate it—they are striking a blow to the constitutional pact that holds us together as a nation. We don’t often think about this pact, or even realize that it’s there—until it’s challenged.Which brings us to the present. Today’s election presents a stark choice. Americans can either respect the basic constitutional structures of our government or trample them with denial and lies. The Constitution is far from perfect. It needs amending. But it is our procedural starting point for change.By voting, you are signaling your belief in this process. You are declaring that you believe in the opportunities presented by democracy, even if they sometimes must be fought for. Democracy isn’t an end point; it’s a process. This election is our opportunity to pledge our allegiance to that process—to the constitutional pact that anchors our nation. The choice is ours.More StoriesI’m a Historian.

CONTENT: It’s more tempting than ever to ignore the election.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.When Bryan Jarrell, an Evangelical pastor in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, came across an election-themed episode of a podcast, he’d skip right over it. He would mute the TV when political ads came on, tried to teach his social-media feeds that he wasn’t interested in politics, and would throw campaign mailers straight in the trash. He’d skim news headlines sometimes, but if he could tell that the story was about national politics, he’d keep scrolling.Today, exactly one week before the election, he will begin researching both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and make a decision about whom to support. He’s not sure where he’ll land—he is conservative on some social issues, but he doesn’t like Trump’s character.Jarrell represents a set of Americans who, out of anxiety, exhaustion, or discouragement, are mostly tuning out campaign coverage yet will ultimately participate in the election. They’re political ostriches who, at the last minute, will take their head out of the sand. “For a decade now, people have started talking about news fatigue,” Ken Doctor, a news-industry analyst, told me. “People are tired of being bombarded with the news. And then it kind of matured into news avoidance.” This tendency escalated with the increasing ubiquity of both online news and Donald Trump, Doctor said.Derek Thompson: Click here if you want to be sadJarrell started purposefully ignoring campaign coverage after he noticed that his parishioners would come to him in the lead-up to elections and describe genuine fear about one candidate or the other taking the White House. He decided to recommend this strategy, of abstaining from the news until the final week of the race, to his parishioners, and to follow it himself.“How much energy did America collectively spend imagining a Biden-Trump election only in July to have Biden drop out?” Jarrell said to me. “If you wait ’til the last week, that’s still enough time to make an informed decision, but you haven’t wasted all that emotional energy stressing about something that may not even come to pass.”A sizable percentage of Americans seems to feel similarly. A 2022 Reuters Institute report found that 42 percent of Americans “sometimes or often actively avoid the news,” up from 38 percent in 2017. The most common reasons people gave for avoiding the news were that it focused too much on politics and COVID, that it was biased, or that it made them feel unhappy or fatigued. In April, the Pew Research Center reported that 62 percent of Americans were already worn out by coverage of campaigns and candidates. A May poll by NORC at the University of Chicago found that 49 percent of those surveyed either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I’m tired of receiving and processing news about the 2024 presidential election.” Not caring about politics is a hallmark of what political scientists call “low information” citizens, but unlike many in the low-information camp, political ostriches do intend to vote. They just don’t feel the need to follow the news in order to do so.The reason ostriches and others avoid political news is simple: “It’s all negative; it’s divisive; I’m sick of it,” the Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told me, relaying the views she hears in focus groups.In Jacksonville, Florida, 31-year-old Tawna Barker didn’t watch the debates, and on social media, she scrolls past political news, skipping what she feels are “inflammatory, heavily one-sided articles.” She plans to vote for a third-party candidate. “Neither [Trump nor Harris] really seems like they’re actually going to do anything to help us,” she told me.Barker, who in 2016 supported Bernie Sanders, seemed disappointed by the fact that Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee that year. “Whoever’s running stuff behind the scenes is just gonna pick who they want to pick, and we just have to go along with it,” she said.Cheryl Wilson Obermiller, a 66-year-old near Kansas City, Missouri, told me that she and her husband have swapped watching the news for taking walks or watching, say, Masterpiece Theater. She finds the news inflammatory, addictive, and occasionally insulting to people like her—she’s voting for Trump. She asks herself, “Am I wasting time watching politics when I could be helping my neighbor? And I think that’s something we all have to consider. Am I watching politics that are feeding in me an attitude that would make me look down on or dislike people?”Obermiller still spends about an hour a day either reading or watching the news, down from about four to six hours several years ago. She gets the news that she does consume through Facebook groups and from Fox News’s Greg Gutfeld, “because I think he’s funny, even though a lot of times he says things that I kind of laugh about but I think are kind of mean,” she said.James Fallows: The media learned nothing from 2016Ignoring political news has become easier in recent years. Nearly half of Americans don’t subscribe to any news sources. Those seeking to dodge campaign coverage can choose to spend their time on apolitical TikToks and Instagram reels, and watch Netflix instead of CNN. “For people who are not interested in politics, which is most people, it’s actually easier than ever to not watch news shows, to not have the algorithm in your social-media feeds give you political information,” David Broockman, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, told me.Broockman found in a recent study that just 15 percent of Americans watch at least eight hours of “partisan” TV, such as Fox or MSNBC, each month. “However little you think voters care about politics, you will still always overestimate how much they care,” Broockman said. This helps explain why both Trump and Harris are appearing on podcasts such as The Joe Rogan Experience and Call Her Daddy—they’re trying to get around people’s “I hate politics” filters.If people are tuning out, it might not matter much for the election results. Most people already know whom they’re going to vote for; the universe of truly undecided voters is very small—likely less than 15 percent of the electorate. “The vast, vast, vast majority of voters settle into who they’re voting for, for whatever reasons they are, and then that’s kind of that, and there’s no information that they can get that is going to bump them off,” Dan Judy, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research, told me. “There’s really a small number in most political campaigns of voters who are truly persuadable.” The willfully tuned-out will likely end up voting for whichever party they’ve always supported, but they will have suffered less agita in the process.Jarrell, the pastor, feels that his approach to the news has made him more serene, and has given him more time to focus on his church and his family. “I believe that there’s a loving God in control of the universe,” he said, “and no matter who’s in the Oval Office, God’s still in heaven. And things are going to be okay.” That’s a hope he shares, surely, with Americans of all political persuasions.More StoriesWhat Going ‘Wild on Health’ Looks LikeWhy America Still Doesn’t Have a Female President

CONTENT: Harris was probably doomed from the jump.The political scientist Wilson Carey McWilliams once observed that alienation is not the loss of an old homeland, but the discovery of a new homeland that casts the former in a more dismal light. Today, the country indeed looks alien. The America many of us believed we knew now appears stranger in retrospect: The anger and resentment we may have thought was pitched at a simmer turned out to be at a rollicking boil. And one of liberals’ most cherished shibboleths from 2016—that Trumpism is a movement for aggrieved white men—unraveled in the face of a realignment that saw the GOP appear to give birth to a multiracial working-class movement. A second Trump presidency is the result of this misjudgment.There is plenty of blame to go around, and much of it will be directed at Kamala Harris. Rightly so. Her campaign strategy was often confounding. Harris gambled on suburban-Republican support, which she tried to juice by touring with Liz Cheney and moving right on the border, a strategy that many warned was questionable. Meanwhile, in her quest to bring these new conservative voters into the Democratic fold, Harris neglected many of the voters the party has long relied on. She took far too long to reach out to Black men—despite a year’s worth of polling that said she was losing their support—and when she finally did, she had little to offer them but slapdash policies and half-baked promises. It was the same story for Hispanic men. Despite polling showing Donald Trump increasing his Hispanic support, Harris largely ignored the problem until a month before Election Day, when she stitched together a condescending last-minute “Hombres con Harris” push. As for Arab American voters, she and her surrogates couldn’t be bothered to do much more than lecture them.David A. Graham: What Trump understood, and Harris did notThe results speak for themselves: Trump won a stunning victory in a heavily Black county in North Carolina and carried the largest Arab-majority city, Dearborn, Michigan. Early exit polls suggest that he doubled his Black support in Wisconsin and won Hispanic men by 10 points. Meanwhile, Harris’s scheme to run up the score in the suburbs plainly failed to bear fruit: She underperformed Biden’s numbers with these voters. Simply put, almost nothing about the Harris game plan worked. But as easy as it is to play Monday-morning (or rather, Wednesday-morning) quarterback—and her dubious campaigning provides plenty of material to work with—the reality is that Harris was probably doomed from the jump.The reason is that she had an 81-year-old albatross hanging around her neck: Joe Biden. When Biden got into the 2020 presidential race, he said he was motivated to defeat the man who blamed “both sides” for a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Five years later, Biden’s inability to see his own limitations handed that same man the White House once more. Nobody bears more responsibility for Trump’s reascension to the presidency than the current president. This failure lies at his feet.Biden was supposed to be a one-term candidate. During his 2019 campaign, he heavily signaled that he would not run again if he won. “He is going to be 82 years old in four years and he won’t be running for reelection,” one of his advisers declared. Biden himself promised to be a “transition” candidate, holding off Trump for four years while making room for a fresh Democratic challenger in 2024. “Look, I view myself as a bridge, not anything else,” he said at a Michigan campaign event with Governor Gretchen Whitmer, one of those promising younger Democrats Biden was ostensibly making room for.Of course, that’s not what happened. Scranton Joe, supposed paragon of aw-shucks decency, ultimately wouldn’t relinquish his power. He decided in the spring of 2023 to run for reelection despite no shortage of warning signs, including a basement-level approval rating, flashing bright red. He also ignored the will of the voters. As early as 2022, an overwhelming percentage of Democratic voters said they preferred a candidate other than Biden, and support for an alternative candidate persisted even as the president threw his hat back in the ring. This past February, one poll found that 86 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats believed Biden was too old to serve another term, and another revealed that only a third of Americans believed that he was mentally fit for four more years.The idea that Americans would vote for a man who they overwhelmingly thought was too old and cognitively infirm stretched reason to its breaking point. And yet Biden and his enablers in the Democratic Party doubled down on magical thinking. This was a species of madness worthy of King Lear shaking his fist before the encroaching storm. And like Lear, what the current president ultimately raged against was nature itself—that final frailty, aging and decline—as he stubbornly clung to the delusion that he could outrun human biology.Adam Serwer: There is no constitutional mandate for fascismNature won, as it always does. After flouting the will of his own voters, after his party did everything in its power to clear the runway for his reelection bid, and after benefiting from an army of commentators and superfans who insisted that mounting video evidence of his mental slips were “cheap fakes,” Biden crashed and burned at the debate in June. He hung on for another month, fueling the flames of scandal and intraparty revolt and robbing his successor of badly needed time to begin campaigning. And yet when he finally did stand down, Biden World immediately spun up the just-so story that the president is an honorable man who stepped aside for the good of the country.He did not stand down soon enough. The cake was baked. The powers that be decided the hour was too late for a primary or contested convention, so an unpopular president was replaced with an unpopular vice president, who wasted no time in reminding America why her own presidential bid failed just a few years before. The limitations of Harris’s campaign are now laid bare for all to see, but her grave was dug before she ever took the podium at the Democratic National Convention.Harris could not distance herself from Biden’s unpopular record on inflation and the southern border. She could not distance herself from his unpopular foreign policy in the Middle East. She could not break from him while she simultaneously served as his deputy. And she could not tell an obvious truth—that the sitting U.S. president is not fit for office—when asked by reporters, and so she was forced into Orwellian contortions. If the worst comes to pass, if the next four years are as bad as Biden warned, if the country—teetering before the abyss—stumbles toward that last precipice, it will have been American democracy’s self-styled savior who helped push it, tumbling end over end, into the dark.More StoriesRichard Price’s Radical, Retrograde NovelOf Course Black Men Are Drifting Toward Trump

CONTENT: What would you do if you found out that January 6 supporters were your new neighbors?Subscribe to Autocracy in America here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket CastsHosts Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev talk with Hanna Rosin about the new series We Live Here Now. Rosin, along with her co-host, Lauren Ober, recently found out that their new neighbors moved to Washington, D.C., to support January 6 insurrectionists. Rosin and Ober decided to knock on their neighbors’ door. We Live Here Now is a podcast series about what happened next. Subscribe to We Live Here Now here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | iHeartThe following is a transcript of the episode:Anne Applebaum: This is Anne Applebaum.Peter Pomerantsev: And this is Peter Pomerantsev, and we’re here with a guest today, The Atlantic’s Hanna Rosin.Hanna Rosin: Hi.Applebaum: And although our series, Autocracy in America, has wrapped up, there is still a lot to do and think about ahead of the 2024 election.Pomerantsev: Hanna is the host of The Atlantic’s weekly show called Radio Atlantic, and she’s also just released a new podcast called We Live Here Now, a series.Rosin: Yeah, We Live Here Now is the story of my partner, Lauren Ober, and I discovering that we had some new neighbors, and it’s about our effort to get to know these neighbors. And it turned out, those neighbors were supporting the January 6 insurrectionists.Pomerantsev: At the end of this episode, we’ll include the entire first episode for listeners to hear. But we want to start with a little clip that gives you a sense of what first launched them into making the series.Lauren Ober: I guess it started just like any other dog walk. Hanna and I leashed up our pups and set out from our house on our post-dinner stroll. It was early November of 2023, and I remember it was unseasonably warm. We headed off down the hill from our house towards our neighborhood park.Rosin: A block past the park, Lauren spotted it: a black Chevy Equinox with Texas plates we’d seen parked around the neighborhood. Just a basic American SUV. Except for the stickers that covered the back windshield.Ober: Stickers we’re very much not used to seeing in our mixed-race, mixed-income neighborhood. Our vibe is more like, Make D. C. the 51st state and No taxation without representation. These stickers were a combo platter of skulls and American flags. There was a Roman numeral for three, the symbol of a militia group called the Three Percenters, and the pièce de résistance, a giant decal in the center of the back window that read Free Our Patriots, J4, J6. Meaning, Justice for January 6.Rosin: Lauren notices every new or different thing in the neighborhood. And this car was definitely different. As we walked past it, Lauren said what she always said when we saw this car.Ober: “There’s that fucking militia mobile again.” Right after I said that moderately unneighborly thing, the passenger-side window rolled down. Cigarette smoke curled out of the car. And the person inside shouted, “Justice for J6!”Rosin: To which Lauren said—Ober: “You’re in the wrong neighborhood for that, honey.” And then the woman in the car said words I’m not gonna forget anytime soon: “We live here now. So suck it, bitch.”Applebaum: Hanna, I’ve had confrontation experiences myself.I was once at a dinner in Poland—this is a couple years ago—with old friends who suddenly started repeating a conspiracy theory about the government, and it happened to be the government that my husband had been part of. And I tried to listen politely and go like, Uh-huh, yeah, that’s true, yeah, sure. And then eventually I left the room.Rosin: Uh-huh.Applebaum: And I’m not sure I could have lasted even that long with people who weren’t old friends and were doing the same thing. So we’re not going to talk all about We Live Here Now, since many listeners may not have yet heard the podcast, but I do want you to tell me a little bit more about that experience of being shouted down in your neighborhood—or, more accurately, being with your partner as she was being shouted down. Were you never tempted to argue back?Rosin: Yeah, I mean, I really think it’s an accident of how the interaction happened. If it had happened at dinner, I guess you can temper yourself, like you just described. You could never see these people again. Like, you could ignore them or shout them down and then choose to never see them again. But because these people lived a couple of blocks away, I sort of knew I was going to see them a lot. So maybe that muted my reaction. My partner doesn’t have a mute button, but I just kind of knew that I better take a step back and think about what I want to do, because I was going to run into these people who, you know, happen to have militia stickers and are seemingly aggressive. So I just kind of needed a minute to think what I wanted to do. Without that pause, I’m not sure this story would have happened in the way that it happened.Pomerantsev: And how did you build the relationship with them? I mean, was it, was there any kind of discomfort or danger involved when you first met them? And then, but most importantly, how did you build trust? I mean, how would they learn to trust you?Rosin: You know, it’s interesting. Once you decide to step into an alternative world, it’s almost like you have to make the decision. Most of the time, we just don’t make that decision. We’re like, This is cuckoo. I’m not going. I don’t share anything in common with these people. Like, we don’t even have a shared set of facts in the way we might have 15, 20 years ago. So there’s just—like, there’s no beginning to this relationship. For whatever reason, we closed our eyes and decided to step into that alternative reality. And once you make that decision, you just do it very, very, very gingerly.In this case, they happen to do a public event, which we knew was happening every single night, and it’s out on a street corner in D.C. And it’s public space. So that actually gave us the freedom to show up at this public event. It’s outside the D.C. Jail, and they’re in support of the January 6 prisoners. The detainees are all held in a segregated wing of the D. C. Jail, so they hold a protest every single night at the exact same time. So you know, you can steel yourself up every night and say like, Okay, tonight’s the night I’m going to go to the vigil, you know?Applebaum: Can I actually ask you some more about that vigil? Because one of the things We Live Here Now does, it explores the way in which people can rewrite history, which is one of the things that happens. And you talk about how at the vigil, there are posters with faces of people who died on January 6. And each poster reads Murdered by Capitol Police, even though only one person was found to have died from a bullet fired by the police, And so there’s now a narrative that the people in jail are the good guys and the people outside of jail are the bad guys. I actually spent 20 years writing books about the history of the Soviet Union, and this is very much what autocratic regimes do: They change the way you remember history. They make heroes out of villains, and vice versa. And how, how did you see that happening and how did you come to understand how it worked? Why was it successful among the people that you were visiting?Rosin: Well, that was one of the most remarkable experiences I had—is being that close to watching revisionism happen. Like, the nitty-gritty, going back and time and, Okay, when was the first time that Trump mentioned Ashli Babbitt?, who is the woman who was shot by the Capitol Police officers? Because initially, right after January 6, many—even Trump supporters—said, you know, The Capitol Police officer did a good job. You know, He did his duty. It was a terrible day. Like, if you look at things that happened in early January, everybody was sharing the reality of what happened on January 6. And then you watch how, slowly, kind of people peel away from that reality. Trump starts trying out lines at his rallies. Oh, Ashli Babbitt was murdered. He uses the words, “they,” a lot. You know, they killed Ashli Babbitt. They did this. And at that point, the Big Lie—the lie that the election was stolen—could have faded away, like it felt like a moment where it could have just been relegated to history, and then it’s like, all of a sudden, there’s this collective decision, Oh no, we’re going to revive this. And the way we’re going to revive it is by talking first about this martyr, and then about this group of people, and suddenly black is white and white is black.And because these people who we got close to, they’re sort of innocents in this narrative. One of the main characters is Micki Witthoeft, who’s the mother of Ashli Babbitt. And just think about that. She’s a grieving mother. It’s as if her emotional-grief reality starts to align with Trump’s messaging in this perfect storm, and then all of a sudden, things that aren’t true seem, not just true, but righteous.Pomerantsev: Tell me a bit about the myth, though, because on the one hand, it’s an alternative reality, which you described so well just now, but on the other hand, isn’t it quite American at the same time? I mean, I love when you talk about, you know, how they describe themselves as “saving democracy.” They’re the true patriots. I mean, as you encountered it, did you find it completely alien myth or something that actually sort of resonated with so many American stories about themselves: rebelling against Washington, the whole—Rosin: Yes, I mean, one thing that I came to feel about the January 6 detainees, like, often it would pop into my head: them in costume, like, Okay, they’re, they’re sort of role-playing 1776 here, you know. Particularly, one of our episodes is about a jury trial. My partner was very randomly called onto a jury, as many people in D.C. are, and it happened to be a January 6 case. And not only that, but it happened to be one of these January 6 cases in which you feel that someone just kind of lost it for a day. You know, it’s a dad; he has five children; by a judge's count, extremely law abiding; been married for a long time. But then during that day, just kind of, you know, went nuts.And as you get closer to what they did that day, you do feel like there was just a rush, like a rush of sort of feeling heroic, you know, feeling patriotic, feeling like you were saving the country, feeling like you have this incredible mission. And then I think, one thing that nobody predicted is that they did keep these guys in a segregated wing of the D.C. Jail, together. We don’t usually do that. I mean, Gitmo is the other place where we’ve done that. But the D.C. Jail is largely Black. And so these guys had a reputation at that day, if you remember, as being white supremacists, so they did not want to throw them into the D.C. Jail. But the result of keeping them together, I mean, you can imagine what happened.Applebaum: So this is exactly the thing that I wanted to ask you about. I was very struck by one of the characters who you interview and describe. This is Brandon Fellows, who was a guy who was almost accidentally caught up in January the 6th. He entered the Capitol. He wound up smoking a joint in one of the offices in the Capitol. As a result, he was arrested. And because he was part of this group of prisoners, he was essentially radicalized. And that story of how the prisoners together radicalized one another, created a mythology around themselves, it reminded me of so many other moments in history when that’s happened, I mean, for both good and for bad. The IRA in British prisons radicalized; um, various jihadis and various prisons around the world are said to have radicalized that way too. But also the ANC in South Africa, who were together in a prison on Robben Island for many years. I mean, that’s how they created their cohesive movement. So it can work positively too. Weren’t you tempted to try and talk him out of it, where you—did you not want to say, “Don’t you see what’s happening to you?”Rosin: Yeah, I mean, with him, that instinct was very powerful because, you know, he’s slightly older than my oldest child. And so I—so in his case, I did have the instinct of, like, trying to shake this out of him.Like, “Don’t you see?,” like “You were in this—you were in this jail,” you know, and he was in this jail. He came in as a goofball. Then he came to see these guys as, like, fierce and tough. And by the end, he came to see them, as you said, Peter, as true patriots, so it’s not just that they were tough guys. It was like they were true and righteous and the next generation of founding fathers and he was just like, Nope, like you just don’t, you don’t get it. I’m deadly serious here.Pomeranstev: So you didn’t build a coalition with them, you didn’t convince them, you don’t try to convince them to change parties. But you spent a year with them. What is it that you found meaningful in that interaction? And why is it meaningful for all of us to hear about it? I mean, it’s fascinating, but also what is the importance of doing something like this?Rosin: I can only tell you about a limited importance, which is that over the last few years, I’ve started to read—as I bet you guys have—you know, what do you have, like, we all throw up our hands: We’re so polarized. We’re not even living in the same reality. We can’t talk to each other.You cannot go into a conversation, as much as you deeply, deeply want to, with the intention of changing the other person’s mind. That is a losing strategy. Don’t do it. It’s so hard. It’s as hard in politics as it is in a relationship. It’s very hard because we all just want to do that. And so your only option is to just open your mind, hear what they have to say, be curious, ask questions, and that’s it.Applebaum: And how do you do that without becoming angry?Rosin: It’s— [Laughs.] I mean, that’s your, they just, because I’ve been to enough couples therapy [Laughs.] that it’s like, that’s your only option. And you almost have to do it with a leap of faith that there’s something human at the end of that.Pomerantsev: So the meaning, in a way, is learning to just behave and interact in a different way.Rosin: There are surprising kind of moments of non-nastiness that arise when you approach the world from that perspective.Pomerantsev: I mean, I spend a lot of my time writing about propaganda and talking to people with all sorts of deeply warped beliefs, and at one point I realized that the only worthwhile question I could ask that would lead to a conversation that was human was, How did it start? How did you start believing in X?Rosin:Yes.Pomerantsev: And then you’d always get a very personal story.Rosin: Yes.Pomerantsev: Usually about some sort of trauma. I’m not saying that’s any kind of excuse, but it suddenly became a human story about how someone is making sense of the world.Rosin: Yes.Pomerantsev: And suddenly there was a person. Again, I never changed them. They’re still gonna do horrible things, but at least I knew they were a person. I don’t know. Maybe, in the long run, that helps us come up with better strategies to deal with it. But not immediately. It’s not a like aha moment.Rosin: Yeah. It’s not a kumbaya. It’s just like, it really is a leap of faith ’cause as you’re doing it, you feel, Am I doing something dangerous? Like humanizing this propaganda? Like, Is this wrong, what I’m doing? And you just kind of live with that doubt and you keep asking questions, you know?Pomeranstev: Yeah. But humans do lots of bad things. Humanizing doesn’t mean making it good; it just makes it human. You know, that doesn’t—it's like, Ooh, humanizing. Yeah, I think maybe the word humanizing needs to lose its positive aura. Humans are pretty awful.Rosin: That’s a pretty good idea.Pomeranstev: But they are human. [Laughs.]Rosin: So what is the point of humanizing if you remove the positive aspects? Humanizing is good because …Pomerantsev: You start to see the challenge for what it is rather than something esoteric. You know, it’s a real person doing real things. Therefore we can deal with it.Applebaum: Hanna Rosin is the co-host along with Lauren Ober of the new six-part podcast series from The Atlantic called We Live Here Now. Find We Live Here Now wherever you listen to podcasts.Pomerantsev: And we have the first episode here. Keep listening and, Hanna, thanks for talking with us today.Rosin: Thank you both.[We Live Here Now Episode 1: “We’re Allowed to Be Here”]Lauren Ober: When the neighbor incident first happened, it didn’t really feel much like anything. Or maybe we were both too stunned to take it all in.Hanna Rosin: It wasn’t until we started telling other people the story and they reacted that it began to feel like maybe we’d discovered something.Ober: I guess it started just like any other dog walk. Hanna and I leashed up our pups and set out from our house on our post-dinner stroll. It was early November of 2023, and I remember it was unseasonably warm. We headed off down the hill from our house, towards our neighborhood park.[Music]Rosin: A block past the park, Lauren spotted it: A black Chevy Equinox with Texas plates we’d seen parked around the neighborhood. Just a basic American SUV except for the stickers that covered the back windshield—Ober: —stickers we’re very much not used to seeing in our mixed-race, mixed-income neighborhood. Our vibe is more like, Make D.C. the 51st state, and, No taxation without representation.But these stickers were a combo platter of skulls and American flags. There was a Roman numeral for three—the symbol of a militia group called the Three Percenters—and the pièce de résistance: a giant decal in the center of the back window that read, free our patriots. j4j6, meaning, Justice for January 6.Rosin: Lauren notices every new or different thing in the neighborhood, and this car was definitely different.

So suck it, bitch.”We’ll get to who that person is soon enough. But we’re not there yet. When we first encountered the woman from the car, we had no idea who we were dealing with. I just knew I was sufficiently put in my place. “Well, okay,” I remember saying to Hanna as we walked back home.Rosin: I remember, after it happened, we walked away in total silence. That’s my memory—each of us looping in our own heads about something.Ober: I remember being mad because I lost. (Laughs.)Rosin: Right.Ober: Because I didn’t get the final word, and because I just kept thinking, like, the whole combination of it felt bad to me. It’s like, Militia stickers. Justice for J6. We live here. You just called me a name. The whole thing was very out of place. And I felt it was a little destabilizing.Rosin: Yeah, yeah. I walked home in a half hypervigilant-neighborhood-watch brain—like, Who lives here now? What are they doing here? Are we going to get into more of these confrontations?—and a half journalism brain, like, Who’s we? Where do they live? Why are there here now? Those were my two tracks when I was walking home.[Music]Ober: I’m Lauren Ober.Rosin: And I’m Hanna Rosin.Ober: And from The Atlantic, this is We Live Here Now.Most of the country watched January 6 from a safe distance: something happening in their Twitter feeds or on their phone screens. But for those of us living in D.C., it was happening in our backyard.Donald Trump: I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.Rioter: Start making a list. Put all those names down. And we start hunting them down one by one.Person on bullhorn inside Congress: We had a disbursement of tear gas in the Rotunda. Please be advised there are masks under your seats. Please grab a mask.[Music]All Things Considered host Ailsa Chang: In Washington, D.C., a curfew has now taken effect from 6 p.m. Eastern tonight to 6 a.m. Thursday morning.Ober: So we were actually left with the wreckage of that day. We were in a militarized city. We were living under a curfew. Streets were blocked off. The windows were all boarded up. And you felt like you were living, if not in a warzone, in a dangerous place.Rosin: And there was National Guard everywhere. All the stores were closed, and there were very few regular people walking around doing regular things. And I was just thinking, Where am I? What city is this?Ober: Right. I bought a baseball bat for protection.Rosin: I remember that.Ober: Which is why, two-plus years later, it felt like this whole period of time we’d rather forget was racing back. Donald Trump was looking like he’d be the Republican nominee, and a second Trump presidency seemed possible. Plus, we had a car with militia stickers lurking in our neighborhood.Rosin: So no, we did not welcome January 6 supporters creeping back to the scene of the crime. But also, we wanted to know what they were up to.[Music]Ober: In the immediate aftermath of January 6, there were three names I associated with what happened at the Capitol: The QAnon Shaman, for obvious reasons; Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes because he seemed really dangerous, and also he had an eye patch; and Ashli Babbitt, who has everything to do with our new neighbors’ arrival in D.C.Four people died that day, but I only remember hearing about Ashli. Maybe that’s because she was the only rioter killed by law enforcement.Ashli Babbitt was a Trump diehard, so it’s not surprising she made her way to D.C. for the rally. She was a Second Amendment–loving libertarian. She wholeheartedly believed in MAGA and QAnon. During the pandemic, she was hostile about mask mandates and refused to get vaccinated. When California issued a stay-at-home order, she tweeted, “This is that commie bullshit!”Rosin: The day before her death, Ashli tweeted in QAnon speak: “Nothing will stop us....they can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon D.C. in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”Ashli Babbitt: We are walking to the Capitol in a mob. There’s an estimated over 3 million people here today. So despite what the media tells you, boots on ground definitely say something different. There is a sea of nothing but red, white, and blue.Ober: On the day of the riots, she seemed genuinely thrilled to be there.Babbitt: And it was amazing to get to see the president talk. We are now walking down the inaugural path to the Capitol building, 3 million plus people. God bless America, patriots.Rosin: More like 50,000 people, give or take. And a few thousand of them went into the Capitol—or, more accurately, broke in. When the mob of protestors breached the Capitol, busting windows and breaking down doors, Ashli was right there in the mix.Rioter: There’s so many people. They’re going to push their way up here.Rosin: There are four videos shot by rioters that capture this moment in its entirety: Ashli strides down a hallway like she knows where she’s going. She’s followed by other rioters, but they’re suddenly stopped when they come to a set of doors with large window panels. Through the windows, you can make out congresspeople being evacuated away from the growing mob. The crowd Ashli is with has accidentally landed at the bullseye, the actual place where these congresspeople were about to certify the election.[Crowd noise]Rosin: On the other side of the doors is a cop with a gun, although it’s unclear if Ashli can see him. She’s the only woman in a sea of men, and she’s small, and she seems to be yelling.Ashli: It’s our fucking house. We’re allowed to be in here. You’re wrong.Rosin: “It’s our fucking house. We’re allowed to be in here. You’re wrong.”One of the rioters breaks a window, and then, out of nowhere, Ashli tries to climb through it.[Crowd noise]Rosin: The cop shoots.Rioter: Oh! Oh, shit! Shots fired! Shots fired!Rosin: She immediately falls backwards and lands on the floor. She jerks and convulses, and blood pours out of her mouth.Rioter 1: She’s dead.Rioter 2: She’s dead?Rioter 1: She’s dead. I saw the light go out in her eyes. I saw the lights go out.Rioter 2: What happened, bro? Tell the world.Rosin: And then something happens right after she dies. It’s a detail I missed at first, but it turned out to be a spark for everything that would happen since that day. People around Ashli take out their cell phones and start filming.Rioter 1: This individual says he actually saw her die. He actually saw her die.Rioter 2: I’ll post that video. I have the video. I have the video of the guy with the gun, and they’re shooting her.Rioter: Okay. I want to get with you. I’m with Infowars.com. I’m with Infowars.com.Rioter 2: “Jayden X.” Have you ever heard of that?Rosin: One person says he’s from Infowars and offers to buy footage from someone closer.Rioter 1: I want to get your info right now if you got that shot.Rioter 2: I have it all. I was right at the door.Rioter 2: Okay. I need that footage, man. It’s going to go out to the world. It’s going to change so much.Rosin: Even in the chaos they realize: A martyr was born.Ober: Rumors spread immediately that the woman killed was 25, 21, a mere teenager. In actual fact, Ashli was 35. But the details didn’t matter. She was a young, white woman in the prime of her life shot dead by a Black officer. People were quick to point out that she was a veteran—a war hero, even—purportedly upholding her oath to defend the Constitution when she died.On far-right, pro-Trump message boards post-January 6, Ashli was called a freedom fighter and the “first victim of the second Civil War.” One person wrote: “Your blood will not be in vain. We will avenge you.”Rosin: People who came to January 6 thought they were saving our democracy from evil forces trying to steal an election.Three years later, some of them still think that. And now, those same evil forces are keeping J6 “freedom fighters” in prison. Justice for January 6—that’s what those window stickers on the Chevy are about.Ober: This conspiracy has gotten more elaborate over time: The insurrection was a setup, or, The prosecution of January 6 rioters represented gross government overreach, or, The government can turn on its own citizens, even kill them.Rosin: A lot of the people who believe these things have taken their cues from one woman: Ashli’s mother. Her name is Micki Witthoeft.Micki Witthoeft: Ashli was a beloved daughter, wife, sister, granddaughter, niece, and aunt. But beyond that, she was the single bravest person I have ever known. She was the quintessential American woman. Today is a dark day for our family and this country, for they have lost a true patriot. I would like to invite Donald J. Trump to say her name—[Music]Ober: It took us a minute, but with the help of some friends, we finally figured out that Micki was our new neighbor. I wasn’t sure what I thought about having Ashli Babbitt’s grieving mother come back to the place where her daughter was killed. Why was she here, in our D.C. neighborhood? What did she want? Was there some sort of future Jan. 6 on the horizon? It all felt just a little too close for comfort.In the days after our run-in with the neighbor, I Googled ’til my eyeballs dried out. There were a lot of videos on social media that featured Micki but not a lot of solid information. I reported what I could find to Hanna.Ober: Do you want to know what the house is called?Rosin: What?Ober: The Eagle’s Nest.Rosin: Oh, stop. (Laughs.) What?Ober: Yeah.Rosin: No, we don’t have the Eagle’s Nest in our neighborhood.Ober: What does the Eagle’s Nest mean to you?Rosin: Some patriot thing.Ober: No. Well, sure, one would think, Oh, it’s patriotic, right? American Eagle.Rosin: Mm-hmm.Ober: It’s where all the eagles go. But do you know who else had a very particular property called the Eagle’s Nest?Rosin: No.Ober: Well, I’ll tell you. It’s Adolf Hitler. However, to quote Micki, who explained to HuffPost why they called the house the Eagle’s Nest:Ober: She said, We call our house the Eagle’s Nest, which some would say was Hitler’s hideout. But we’re American citizens, and we won that war, and we’re taking back the name. So this is absolutely not an ode to Hitler.Ober: Here’s what else I found out: The online videos of Micki didn’t exactly make me want to bring over a tray of homemade, “Welcome to the neighborhood” brownies. Lots of shouting and scowling and general unpleasantness.Witthoeft: Why are you all here if you’re going to let that happen? He said, Why the hell are you all here?Person 2: He said that to you? That was very unprofessional!Person 3: They’re fascists.Ober: In one clip online, Micki is being arrested for “blocking and obstructing roadways.” She was at a march to honor the second anniversary of her daughter’s death, and she walked into the street one too many times. The D.C. cops did not appreciate that, and they let her know it.It wasn’t the only time she got into it with the cops. A year later—Witthoeft: I try to show y’all respect. I’ve been arrested twice, and I’ve done it peacefully. That’s bullshit. Your man is bullshit. That’s bullshit.Officer: I wasn’t down here, so I can speak to how—Ober: There were more than a few videos of Micki and her housemates getting into dustups with D.C. folks who didn’t seem to appreciate their presence in their city.Person 1: Get the fuck outta here.Person 2: Get the fuck off of me, bitch. Get the fuck off, the fuck off. Get the fuck off.Person 3: Hey! We caught it on video.Person 2: Stop fucking touching my shit.Person 3: Get out of here, you pansy.Ober: But later, in the same video, there’s this: Our new neighbors are getting harassed by anti-J6 protestors, folks who like to chalk the sidewalk with phrases like “Micki is a grifter.” There are a number of D.C. cops on the scene. I get tense just watching it. Finally, Micki snaps and screams at them.Officer: I heard all the commotion. That’s why I got out. I can’t see—I didn’t see what happened out here.Person 2: I had to beg him to get out of his car.Witthoeft: You can tell your man that the reason I’m here is because three years ago today, y’all killed my kid. That’s why I’m here.[Music]Ober: Right. She’s a mom, and the police killed her kid. That’s why she’s here. She wants to make sure her dead daughter isn’t forgotten and that someone is held accountable for what happened.And one way to do that is to maybe get yourself arrested, or at least show up everywhere—January 6 trials, congressional hearings, the Supreme Court, rallies, marches, my neighborhood.Another way for people to take notice? A nightly vigil outside the D.C. jail, every single night for more than 700 nights.Rosin: And we mean every night, in the rain or scorching heat. Without fail, Micki and a few supporters stand on what they call Freedom Corner and talk on the phone with the J6 defendants held inside the jail.Ober: As I explained to Hanna:Ober: Every night at 7 p.m., these apparently true patriots—Rosin: Mm-hmm.Ober: —come out, and they have a vigil for all of the January 6 defendants who are currently being held in the jail, either awaiting trial or awaiting sentencing.Rosin: Mm-hmm.Ober: And every night, they get a January 6 inmate on the phone, and they put them on the speaker, and then they join in singing, like, the national anthem or “America the Beautiful,” and they’re chanting, like, “Justice for Ashli.” And the evening ends, often, with “God Bless [the U.S.A.],” Lee Greenwood.Rosin: Who’s the “they”?Ober: So there’s a small cadre of true believers who believe that the people in the D.C. jail are political prisoners.Rosin: Interesting.[Music]Rosin: Interesting is a boring thing to say. I get that. But I was only just starting to put this whole picture together, that Micki and her friends were not in D.C. just to cause chaos. They were here to push a narrative that these people—the same ones who turned our city upside down—were victims of a colossal injustice. And also, that January 6 was actually a totally appropriate exercise of freedom and liberty.And their version of the story was getting traction with some important people—actually, the most important person.Trump: I am the political prisoner of a failing nation, but I will soon be free on November 5, the most important day in the history of our country, and we will together make America great again. Thank you.Rosin: If our interactions with our new neighbors had unfolded more like the typical neighborhood showdown—my MAGA hat versus your dump trump sign—things might have been easier because that would be just straight-up neighbor warfare, pure mutual hatred.Ober: But it didn’t happen that way. Instead, two opposite dramas unfolded: (1) We got an up-close, intimate view of how history gets rewritten. Call it the lost-cause narrative for the 21st century: A group of Americans immediately sets to work retooling the history of an event through tweets and podcasts and viral video clips, in a way that distorts collective memory forever.Rosin: But then, (2) our new neighbors became real people to us. We also got an up-close, intimate view of them, their monumental grief, their sleepless nights, their deep friendship—things that make it harder to purely hate on someone.Ober: This woman, Micki Witthoeft, is many things to many people—Mama Micki to the January 6 defendants, mother of a dead domestic terrorist to others. But to us, she’s something else—she’s our neighbor.Ober: Do you want to hear something rotten?Micki: I don’t know if I do, but I will.Ober: After months of getting to know Micki, I felt like I needed to confess something. She had been telling me how people in the neighborhood had generally been nice to them, except for this one time. One of her roommates, Nicole, had been sitting in the car, and these two women walked by and said something totally rude, and—I know, you’ve already heard the story before.Ober: Nicole sitting in the car—that was me. And I’m fully disgusted with myself and embarrassed. Like, because that’s not how I want to be treated, and that’s not how I want to think about people. But I did it.Micki: Oh, well, I’m surprised you—I’m impressed that you admitted that to me. I really am. That’s going to be interesting when I tell Nicole.Ober: Since that incident, I’ve spent a lot of time with Micki trying to understand her cause, her politics, and her anger. I’ve had many moments where I thought: What the hell am I doing, getting all caught up in their revisionist history of January 6? But what I can tell you is that Micki is not who I thought she was.She is every bit as fiery as she comes off in speeches and confrontations with people who want her out of this city. After nearly a year of knowing her, I’m still terrified of her. I have never before in my life met a person with such penetrating eyes, and she wields them to great effect. If she is staring you down, I promise you, you will find no relief.Ober: So the window rolls down, and I guess Nicole said, you know, “Justice for J6!” Right? Reflexively, in two seconds, I go, “Well, you’re in the wrong neighborhood for that.” Right? Now, I feel like you would appreciate that because sometimes things pop out of your mouth that maybe you didn’t think about. I am a person who is very guilty of that, as my mouth runs away with me.So, I said that, and she goes, “We live here now. So suck it, bitch.” (Laughs.)Micki: That’s my Nicole. (Laughs.)Ober: And I was like, Well, okay.[Music]Rosin: When we first ran into the militiamobile, we didn’t know anything about Micki and her crew. We thought anyone could be living in that house, with that car. Maybe it was an actual militia headquarters with a cache of weapons in the basement. Maybe it was just some wacko whose patriotism had gone totally sideways.Ober: But now, after nearly a year of reporting this story, we know so much more. And in the rest of the series, we are going to take you through this upside-down world we landed in—where we found ourselves talking conspiracies.Micki: I don’t know what I believe them capable of. Is it eating babies and drinking their blood? I don’t think so. But I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know what they’re up to.Ober: How you can suddenly find yourself joking with January 6ers about militias?Nicole: If you’re going to come down here, you’ve got to know your militias straight.Ober: You know, I can’t—there are too many splinter groups and, you know.Nicole: There’s factions. There’s levels. There’s color coding. (Laughs.)Ober: Listen. When the gay militia happens, I’m there, okay? When that happens. Until then—Nicole: Well, we’re a country of militias, you know.Ober: And wondering, What could possibly be coming for us?Rosin: Like, how long are you going to stay in D.C.?Brandon Fellows: I plan to stay ’til, like, January 7. (Laughs.)Rosin: That feels vaguely threatening.Fellows: I could see why you would say that.Rosin: That’s coming up on We Live Here Now.Ober: We Live Here Now is a production of The Atlantic. The show was reported, written, and executive produced by me, Lauren Ober. Hanna Rosin reported, wrote, and edited the series. Our senior producer is Rider Alsop. Our producer is Ethan Brooks. Original scoring, sound design, and mix engineering by Brendan Baker.This series was edited by Scott Stossel and Claudine Ebeid. Fact-checking by Michelle Ciarrocca. Art direction by Colin Hunter. Project management by Nancy DeVille.Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor.The Atlantic’s executive editor is Adrienne LaFrance. Jeffrey Goldberg is The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief.Nicole. And then did I say something like, Well, bitch, I live here now, or something?Ober: Very close to that. “We live here now, so—”Nicole: Get used to it?Ober: No.Nicole: Suck it? Fuck it?Ober: No. You’re right on the “suck it.”Nicole: (Laughs.) I don’t know.Ober: “Suck it,” what? “Suck it,” who?Nicole: Suck it, fascist? (Laughs.) So much more fascist than me. Don’t tell me what I said.Ober: You said, “Suck it, bitch.”Nicole: Oh! Okay. Okay.

CONTENT: Joe Rogan has given his endorsement to Donald Trump as Americans head to the polls in Tuesday's presidential election.The podcaster said he was giving the Republican his backing after being convinced in one of his interviews by tech billionaire Elon Musk, another high-profile supporter of Trump.Rogan's backing could carry significant weight with his young, male listenership - which is also a demographic that Trump has been working hard to court ahead of the 2024 vote. Trump welcomed the endorsement as "great" news.Trump's rival, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, has received endorsements from numerous other top celebrities, including musicians Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.Ahead of polling day, Tuesday, both campaigns have been working to win over undecided voters in an extremely close race.Rogan's endorsement could reach a wide audience, since he enjoys more than 18 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 14 million followers on Spotify.Trump himself appeared on the podcast last month - speaking about topics from the "biggest mistake" of his time in the White House to whether alien life exists. Harris, too, has featured on podcasts during her campaign - but to a lesser extent.Almost 80% of Rogan's audience are men, while half are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to the firm Edison Research. Trump's 2024 campaign has focused on podcasts popular with younger men over traditional media outlets.The race has been characterised by pundits as a story of men v women - with Donald Trump enjoying a huge polling lead among men, and women telling pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin.Katy Perry and Lady Gaga were among the stars who lent their support to Harris on the eve of the election. And at a rally in swing state Pennsylvania, TV host Oprah Winfrey issued an appeal to voters to protect women's reproductive rights.Meanwhile, explaining his endorsement for Trump, Rogan wrote that Mr Musk "makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way".Writing on X to introduce his interview with Musk, Rogan praised "the great and powerful" Mr Musk himself. Tesla founder Mr Musk has appeared at recent Trump rallies and has been giving away prizes of $1m (£770,000) a day to registered voters in battleground states.Trump, who has previously suggested he could reward Elon Musk with a job if he wins the vote, said at a rally that Rogan's backing was "great" and "so nice".The endorsement appears to mark a significant shift in politics for Rogan. He once said he would "probably" vote for Sen Bernie Sanders - a progressive who previously competed for the Democratic presidential nomination himself.As recently as 2022, the podcaster said he did not want to "help" Trump electorally because he was "an existential threat to democracy". He previously lent his support to Robert F Kennedy Jr, then running as an independent presidential candidate.Rogan, who ventured into podcasting after a career as a stand-up comedian, is known for hosting an ideologically diverse mix of guests.Occasionally, this editorial approach has landed him in controversy - for example during the Covid pandemic, when he was accused of spreading vaccine misinformation.Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: People attend a watch party for the US Presidential debate between Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in New York on September 10, 2024.It can be hard to remember from where we sit today, but when this presidential campaign began, it looked a lot like the last one.

Everything sounded familiar, down to the candidates. There was Trump talking about bringing back glory, and Biden wanting to restore the normalcy of a good and decent United States.

Former president Donald Trump and sitting President Joe Biden became the presumptive nominees for their parties in March making it the first presidential rematch since 1956.

We all know sequels are rarely more interesting than the original, and many were frustrated or indifferent to what seemed like a repeat of what we had already seen before.

Anyone with a pulse knows the last year has been anything but predictable.

And while we can't say what the outcome of this election will be, we can say that Americans have just lived through the most dramatic, eventful, unexpected presidential campaign of our lives.You're reading the Consider This newsletter, which unpacks one major news story each day. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to more from the Consider This podcast.Questions surrounding President Biden's fitness to serve in the oval office for a second term had already been circulating for months following his acceptance of the Democratic nomination.

But the June debate in Atlanta between Biden and Trump featured a performance from Biden that sent democrats into a tailspin. Members of the Democratic party began calling for Biden to drop out. But the president was resolute.

Weeks later, former speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi weighed in with an open ended conclusion:

"It's up to the President to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short."

Then, while Democrats were wringing their hands, a major event rocked the Trump campaign when a would-be assassin took aim at the former president while he was onstage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump's ear, while one attendee was killed, and another two were left critically wounded.

As Republicans fervently united around their leader, wearing ear bandages to show their support, Biden became sidelined with COVID.

Finally, on July 21st, the President posted on social media that he was ending his campaign.

He offered his quote "full support and endorsement" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's nominee, cementing the decision in a formal address two days later.Harris would have the shortest runway of any Presidential campaign in modern history. She would need to introduce herself to voters, explain a policy agenda, draw a contrast with Trump, and also choose a running mate.

On August 6th in Philadelphia, she announced her pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D).

Later that month, the Democratic convention in Chicago came with a rush of adrenaline as the party celebrated the first woman of color to lead the Democratic ticket.

The first and only debate between the two presidential candidates came on September 10th, in New York City.

They debated policy positions – including on the economy.

Trump had one view:

"The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90 percent, that the Trump economy was great, that their [democrats] economy was terrible."

Harris had another:

"Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy."

Trump also pushed a false claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying they were eating people's pets.

That led to weeks of threats and violence against the community in Springfield.

And just five days later, Trump was golfing when his life came under threat once again, as Secret Service agents spotted a gunman lurking at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.

He didn't fire, and Trump wasn't harmed.

There's more to recount of course.

CONTENT: China has unveiled new measures aimed at boosting its flagging economy, as it braces for a second Donald Trump presidency.The country plans to tackle tens of billions of dollars of local government debt to prevent it being a drag on growth.Trump won the US election on a platform that promised steep import taxes, including tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods.His victory is now likely to hinder Xi Jinping’s plans to transform the country into a technology powerhouse – and further strain relations between the world’s two biggest economies.A property slump, rising government debt and unemployment, and low consumption have slowed down Chinese growth since the pandemic.So the stakes are higher than ever for the latest announcement from the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the executive body of China's legislature.During his first term in office Trump hit Chinese goods with tariffs of as much as 25%.China analyst Bill Bishop says Trump should be taken at his word about his new tariff plans."I think we should believe that he means it when [he] talks about tariffs, that he sees China as having reneged on his trade deal, that he thinks China and Covid cost him the 2020 election".The pressure from Washington did not ease after Trump left the White House in 2021. The Biden administration kept the measures in place and in some cases widened them.While the first wave of Trump tariffs were painful for China, the country is now in a much more vulnerable position.The economy has been struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of growth since abruptly abandoning its tight Covid restrictions two years ago.Instead of delivering a widely expected fast-paced recovery, China became a regular source of disappointing economic news.Even before Trump's election victory and after China began rolling out measures to support its economy in September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its annual growth target for the country.The IMF now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 4.8% in 2024, at the lower end of Beijing's "about 5%" target. Next year, it projects China's annual growth rate will drop further to 4.5%.The latest plan involves using an additional 6 trillion yuan ($840bn) from now until 2026 to bail out local governments which have piled up unsustainable levels of debt.For decades, local governments have helped drive growth throughout the country by borrowing massive sums of money - much of which paid for infrastructure projects. But a downturn in the property industry has left some cities unable to pay their bills.But the country's leaders were not caught entirely off guard by the end to decades of super-fast growth.Speaking in 2017, President Xi said his country planned to transition from "rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development."The term has since been used repeatedly by Chinese officials to describe a shift to an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and green industries.But some economists say China cannot simply export itself out of trouble.China risks falling into the type of decades-long stagnation that Japan endured after a stock and property bubble burst in the 1990s, Morgan Stanley Asia's former chairman, Stephen Roach, says.To avoid that fate, he says China should draw "on untapped consumer demand" and move away from "export and investment-led growth".That would not only encourage more sustainable growth but also lower "trade tensions and [China's] vulnerability to external shocks," he says.This more robust economic model could help China fend off the kind of threats posed by Trump's return to power.But China, which has long been the world’s factory for low-cost goods, is trying to replicate that success with high-tech exports.It is already a world leader in solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs) and lithium ion batteries.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) China now accounts for at least 80% of solar panel production. It is also the biggest maker of EVs and the batteries that power them.The IEA said last year that China's investments in clean energy accounted for a third of the world's total, as the country continued to show "remarkable progress in adding renewable capacity.""For sure there is an overall effort to support high-tech manufacturing in China," says David Lubin, a senior research fellow at London based-think tank, Chatham House."This has been very successful", he adds.Exports of electric vehicles, lithium ion batteries and solar panels jumped 30% in 2023, surpassing one trillion yuan ($139bn; £108bn) for the first time as China continued to strengthen its global dominance in each of those industries.That export growth has helped soften the blow to China's economy of the ongoing property crisis.“China’s overcapacity will increase, there is not doubt about it. They have no other source of growth,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis.But along with those increased exports, there has been a rise in resistance from Western countries, and not just the US.Just last month, the European Union increased tariffs on Chinese-built EVs to as much as 45%."The problem right now is that large recipients of those goods including Europe and the US are increasingly reluctant to receive them," said Katrina Ell, research director at Moody's Analytics.Today, as Trump is set to head back to the Oval Office with a pledge to hammer Chinese imports, Beijing will have to ask itself whether its latest measures to boost its slowing economy will be enough.The president-elect said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on China on his first day in office.AI services that can describe pictures and scenes are helping the visually impaired.Scientists in the Caribbean are turning algae that have been choking beaches into biofuel.The iconic carmaker's rebrand has certainly caught people's attention, but will it pay off?These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.

CONTENT: The opposition leader of the self-declared republic of Somaliland, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has won the territory’s presidential election.More popularly known as Irro, he won with 64% of the vote to become Somaliland’s sixth president since it broke away from Somalia in 1991.The 69-year-old, a former speaker of Somaliland's parliament, beat incumbent Musa Abdi Bihi, who took 35% of the vote.During campaigning, Irro said his party would review a controversial deal to lease landlocked Ethiopia a 20km (12-mile) section of its coastline for 50 years to set up a naval base - an agreement that has caused a diplomatic feud in the region.As part of the deal, announced on New Year’s Day, Somaliland expects to be recognised by Addis Ababa as an independent nation.This has upset Somalia, which regards Somaliland as part of its territory - and it has said it views the deal as an act of aggression.Irro has never rejected the deal out of hand, but when discussing it has used diplomatic language, which suggests a change of tack.Somaliland is located in a strategic part of the world, and is seen as a gateway to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.Despite its relative stability and regular democratic elections, it has not been recognised internationally."We are all winners, the Somaliland state won," Irro said, commending everyone for the peaceful vote on 13 November that was witnessed by diplomats from nine European countries and the US.He also thanked outgoing President Bihi, who has led the breakaway region since 2017.Critics say Bihi lost support because of a paternalistic style - saying he had been dismissive of public opinion at a time when economic difficulties have undermined the value of the local currency.The president-elect, who will be sworn in on 14 December, is seen as a more unifying figure.But he has said he will continue Somaliland's relations with Taiwan - over which China claims sovereignty.When the two established diplomatic relations in 2021 it angered both China and Somalia.Somaliland is a former British protectorate that joined the rest of Somalia on 1 July 1960.In a conflict leading up to the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991, tens of thousands of people were killed in Somaliland and its main city of Hargeisa was completely flattened in aerial bombardments.In the chaos that followed Barre's departure, Somaliland declared its independence and has since rebuilt the city, created its own currency, institutions and security structures.This is often contrasted to Somalia, which collapsed into anarchy for decades and still faces many challenges, including from Islamist militants, and does not hold direct elections.Born in Hargeisa, Irro went to school in Somalia and later attended college in the US - graduating with a master’s degree in business administration.After university he pursued a diplomatic career, joining Somalia’s foreign service in 1981.He was posted to Moscow where he worked at Somalia’s embassy. During the civil war, he became the country’s acting ambassador to the former Soviet Union.Many people fled Somalia during the conflict, which tore the nation apart, including Irro’s family who went to live in Finland.He was able to be reunited with them there and obtained Finnish citizenship.Irro returned to Somaliland several years later, entering politics in 2002 as co-founder of the opposition Justice and Welfare party (UCID).He went on to serve as speaker of the parliament for 12 years.It was during this time that he established the Wadani Party, which has grown to be a powerful political force in Somaliland and on whose ticket he won this year's election.Additional reporting by Bidhaan Dahir and BBC Monitoring.Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaNetumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is the candidate for the dominant Swapo party but its popularity has waned.Women in Nigeria desperate to conceive are drawn into a disturbing scam involving trafficked babies.The anti-apartheid critic spent seven years in prison for opposing the white minority regime.The boats were carrying mostly Somali nationals, authorities said.Sudan is disintegrating after more than 18 months of civil war, aid chief Jan Egeland warns

CONTENT: The first result of the 2024 US presidential election - from a tiny township with six residents - has been declared, with a clean split of three votes each for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.In a tradition dating back to 1960, residents of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, cast their ballots at the stroke of midnight (05:00 GMT).The remote, unincorporated resort town opened its polling station several hours ahead of much of the country, and delivered its result just 15 minutes later.The tie was fitting for a race so competitive, where small polling margins have made it difficult to tell which candidate might really be ahead.A crowd of journalists watched as the township kicked off election day - to the tune of the US national anthem played on an accordion.One of the voters, Les Otten, was a Republican who cast his ballot for a Democrat for the first time.He said he voted for Harris because she was promising loyalty to voters, while Trump was seeking loyalty from them. He told the BBC World Service that he did not believe this was the right attitude.“If the person that is elected believes that all of us have input and can form the government... that's very different than if they're saying to us 'We need to follow what I say'."Another voter explained that the northeastern state of New Hampshire was a "purple state" and "very divided".Meanwhile, the town voted five to one for a Republican governor and four to two for a Democratic congresswoman.In 2020, all six residents voted for Joe Biden - reportedly making him only the second presidential hopeful to win unanimous support from the town since 1960.The town also participated in the vote to select this year's Republican presidential nominee - unanimously supporting Nikki Haley.Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

However, Rogan said he hoped to speak with Harris in the future."My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being," Rogan wrote. "I really hope we can make it happen."Abortion, gender and the 'bro vote':6 things that could decide if Harris or Trump winsActor Harrison Ford endorsed Harris."Look I've been voting for 64 years," the "Indiana Jones" actor said in a black-and-white video clip posted online.

CONTENT: By Juana Summers, Jason Fuller, Patrick JarenwattananonMembers of the class of 2016 are presented with their degrees during the commencement ceremony at Howard University in May, 2016.The absolute number of Black men enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is the lowest it's been since 1976.That's according to recent analysis from the American Institute for Boys and Men, which crunched data from the Department of Education.In fact, Black men now currently account for only 26% of the students at HBCUs — back in 1976, that figure was 38%.All Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Calvin Hadley — assistant provost for academic partnerships and student engagement at Howard University — about what's happening, what's lost when Black men don't attend HBCUs, and how he is trying to close this gap.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Juana Summers: I want to start by talking about Howard, which, of course, is one of the foremost HBCUs in this country — a long, long list that I cannot recite of incredible alumni, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Let's start there. Are you seeing this decline among Black male students where you are?Calvin Hadley: I am. I'm a Howard alum, and so I remember as a student, the numbers were also pretty stark at that time. I think we were around 33-34% when I was a student, between 2004 and 2008. Now, as you announced in your introduction, Howard University is around 25% male total. And I think a recent statistics said around 19% Black male. And so that is felt on campus, that is felt, I think, in our social clubs, it's felt on the yard. And I think many of our male students have commented that in some of their classes, they're the only male in their class.Vice President Kamala Harris greets supporters at a campaign rally at South Carolina State University in February.Summers: So I will just say, I did not attend an HBCU. I attended a PWI — a predominantly white institution — but I have so many friends and family members who attended HBCUs. They talk to me about what that experience has meant to them, not just while they're on campus, but when they go out into their professional lives. They stay connected to the HBCU experience. They stay connected to communities like the Howard community that you represent. So I just want to ask you, when there are fewer Black men on campus, walk us through: what does that mean? What do we lose when those Black men are not as robust a presence on campuses like yours?Hadley: By the time students actually come to college, we're dealing with the males that have actually transcended what we call the “belief gap” — this gap in between what students can actually achieve and what their professors, teachers, counselors believe they can achieve. For Black males, that gap is the largest. When they get into the campus, the campus experiences are significantly impacted by the imbalance, right?At every educational institution, we want a diversity of experience. And so when you don't have as many males in the classroom, that diversity of experience is significantly impacted. It gets even more scary when we trace it forward, right? I think we're dealing with some really unique statistics right now. Black males are graduating at a much lower rate than Black females.Summers: And that's across all colleges.Hadley: Across all colleges, not just HBCUs. And so this drop in the past decade has been seen more drastically. But the reality is, this is not a Howard problem. This is not an HBCU problem. This is not a PWI problem. This is an American education problem.Summers: I want to shift gears a bit and talk about what happens when these Black men are graduating from high school and they're deciding what comes next, what that next step is. The study that we've been talking about, it notes that since 2010, as you point out, Black male enrollment has gone down across all colleges. And it also points out that HBCU enrollment has also decreased on the whole, but the decline of Black male enrollment at HBCUs outpaces those trends, if only slightly. Can you just explain to me how you understand that gap?Hadley: So I want to take a small step back. In 2013-14 we had 2990 male applicants for Howard University specifically. In 2022-23 we had 9705. A significant, significant increase.Howard University graduates arrive for the 2023 Commencement Ceremony in May, 2023.Summers: And what does that say to you?Hadley: That the Howard University education, and the HBCU education, is highly sought after, right? And there are a number of really important things that happened between 2012 and 2022 — one of those was the election of President Donald Trump, another was the murder of George Floyd. I think when those things happen in the United States of America, the HBCU experience, which had already been known to many of us, had now become a much more attractive proposition. You notice a significant increase in those male applications.What I didn't provide you was the number of female applications that accompany that. While we received 9700 male applications in 2022-23, we received upwards of 30,000 female applications. And I want to take a step aside and say Black women are ripping it up. All the statistics show, from high school to college to college graduation, that the Black women is successful today, and the trajectory is going straight up. Unfortunately, when you look at the Black male, the exact opposite is the case. And so for those Black males that are now being left out of the college equation, that also means they're being left out and stratified out of a certain portion of our society.What we now will have is an imbalance in the community that has a significant impact on our ability to create whole families, I think. On the ability for us to ensure that our generations after us have additional success, and really to have additional mobility.Summers: I want to end on this: You are a product of Howard University, as you point out. You now work for the university. And you're raising two young Black boys. What's your pitch for why a young Black man who might be hearing our conversation in 2024 should choose to attend an HBCU?Hadley: Wow. Thank you for that. You attend an HBCU for an education and not a degree, and as an assistant provost, that's not a popular thing to say. The education that you receive in an HBCU transcends the classroom experience. It transcends the relationship that you have with your professor. The education exists in between the lines of the pages. HBCUs inundate you with the sense of belief. We talked about the importance of that belief on the front end, the belief gap that exists in K through 12.HBCUs are created to instill you with the belief that you can be even larger than you can dream. Howard University and the HBCU community has provided me — and many other people, like our vice president — with the sense that I am enough. I can be successful academically. But my world is not simply academics. I can be enough and I can contribute to this society, in this space, in a way that allows me to feel whole and allows me to contribute to something much larger than myself. The HBCU community needs you. And so when I'm talking to that young man in 2024: Come because we need you. Come because you're important. Come because without you, our community is hurt.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: Calls to a voting rights helpline more than doubled on the day of the 2024 election compared to four years earlier, according to data exclusively supplied to Newsweek.Nonpartisan voting rights group VoteRiders said the number of voters who called or texted its helpline, which offers advice regarding the documents voters need to prove their identity, increased by 261 percent in 2024 relative to the 2020 presidential election.The issue of voting rights loomed large in the 2024 election, with supporters of Republican President-elect Donald Trump seeking tougher measures after alleging without evidence that the 2020 election was stolen from him while Democratic Party supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris often saw measures to toughen ID requirements as possibly discriminating against minority groups.A total of 35 states required a government-issued identification to vote in person in the 2024 presidential election. Of these, 24 required a photo identification such as a driver's license or a U.S. passport. That is four more states than required the same in the 2020 election.Of the 24 states with photo ID, some have issued strict laws meaning those without valid ID may be turned away until they can provide it. Others have more lenient laws that allow people to vote subject to additional checks like matching their ID signatures to their voting registration signatures to prove their identity, or by casting a provisional ballot, meaning a ballot is counted subject to verifying the voter's identity after the election.VoteRiders staff told Newsweek that it fielded nearly 12,000 inquiries this year to date from voters by call, text, or email.Concerns they said they heard from callers included people seeking guidance about the type of ID they should bring to the polling stations, students using student ID that they say wasn't accepted at the ballot box and people who said they were denied provisional ballots because they had no ID.VoteRiders said they received calls from voters in nearly every state, but the largest number of calls came from Texas (11 percent), Florida (10 percent) and Georgia (9 percent). In Texas, people must vote with photo IDs but can use alternative IDs without photos in some circumstances. In Florida, photo ID is required but those without it can cast a provisional ballot. In Georgia people need photo ID either in person or absentee.Newsweek contacted the Texas, Florida and Georgia secretary of state's offices to comment on this story.Lauren Kunis, CEO of VoteRiders said the data showed "the extent to which voter ID laws confuse and intimidate voters."She told Newsweek the incidents "illustrate the ongoing challenges in making sure that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot that counts, and the rising challenges to doing so."Voter ID rules have faced criticism in the past, with the American Civil Liberties Union calling the concept "discriminatory" against minority voters. Trump has previously spoken out in favor of requiring voter ID, calling it "the real deal."In the November 2022 midterm elections, calls to VoteRiders increased 287 percent compared to 2021, the last comparable election year.Meanwhile, ahead of the 2024 election, concerns were previously raised that transgender voters could be disenfranchised due to the strictest of voter ID rules where differing facial features and potential "dead names" on ID cards, the name a transgender person is given at birth but no longer uses after transitioning, may cause confusion.In this year's election, Trump secured 312 Electoral College votes in the race against Harris, who won 226 votes. The Republican Party has also taken control of the Senate 52 seats to 47, and is leading in Pennsylvania which has not yet been called. The GOP will also have control of House of Representatives with a 218-209 seat lead and 8 races left to be called.Newsweek Is Committed To Journalism That'S Factual And Fair.Hold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.Kate Plummer is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on U.S. politics and national affairs, and ... read more

CONTENT: President Joe Biden has tried to clarify his comments after he appeared to call supporters of Donald Trump "garbage", sparking conservative uproar.He was responding to a comic who courted controversy during a routine at a Trump rally on Sunday by referring to Puerto Rico as an "island of garbage".“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden was initially quoted as saying on Tuesday, prompting Republican backlash.The White House later released a transcript which included an apostrophe, and said the president was talking about the words of Trump rally comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, and not tens of millions of Trump supporters."The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump's] supporter’s… his demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American," the transcript reads.Biden himself later addressed his video call with non-profit organisation Voto Latino, writing on X: "Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage - which is the only word I can think of to describe it."His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation."White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at a briefing that Biden "does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump, as garbage".But Trump's backers have seized upon the comments, making comparisons with a controversial remark by Hillary Clinton in 2016 during Trump's first run for office, when she said half of Trump's supporters were from a "basket of deplorables".As the war of words escalated, Trump himself suggested Kamala Harris - his rival for the White House - was running a "campaign of hate".Democrats have in turn criticised Trump for railing at his own rallies against "the enemy from within", which he has said refers to "radical left lunatics" and a couple of Democratic lawmakers.At his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Biden's words were "worse" than what Clinton said."You know what's worse than anything? Garbage, We're garbage" he said, going on to praise his supporters as the "heart and soul of America".Asked about the remark on Wednesday, Harris said Biden had "clarified his comments", adding: "Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for."Biden's comments on the furore threatened to overshadow a rally on Tuesday evening by Kamala Harris, who is running for the White House as the Democratic nominee after Biden pulled out earlier in the contest.Harris delivered what her campaign has called her "closing argument" in Washington DC - at the spot from which Trump spoke shortly before a riot by his supporters at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.She urged voters to "turn the page on the drama and the conflict" in American politics.The Madison Square Garden rally referred to by Biden - during which Hinchcliffe and others sparked offence with a range of comments - was defended on Tuesday by Trump as a "lovefest".He acknowledged that "somebody said some bad things", but said he did not think it was "a big deal".Trump stopped short of issuing an apology demanded by prominent figures from the island itself, which is a US territory. A number of Republicans - including from neighbourhoods with strong Latino populations - expressed outrage.In Philadelphia, in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, members of the 90,000-strong Puerto Rican population told the BBC they would not forget the joke.Residents of Puerto Rico - a US island territory in the Caribbean - are unable to vote in presidential elections, but the large diaspora in the US can.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: As the United States begins to count the votes of what's expected to be a tight election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, China is watching closely and preparing for how either outcome could shape what many in both nations view to be the world's most important bilateral relationship."The U.S. election is one of the most important events affecting not only the development of the United States in the next four years, but also globally, because the U.S. is also the number one country in economy, military, many aspects," Xu Qinduo, a senior fellow at the Pangoal Institution in Beijing, told Newsweek."So that will have some effects, obviously, in every part of the world, including China," he said. "In that sense, the Chinese people and the Chinese government are watching closely what's going on in the U.S., the process, the differences in polices between the two candidates."Among the two rivals, Trump has been particularly vocal on his views of China, frequently accusing the People's Republic of taking advantage of the U.S. and calling for tariffs of 60 percent or higher on all imports from the world's second-largest economy and the U.S.' number three trade partner. At the same time, he's also occasionally expressed admiration for Chinese President Xi Jinping and has a record of seeking deals with ideologically divergent leaders.Harris has largely portrayed the relationship with Beijing as a competition, vowing to ensure that the U.S. would come out on top as the global leader of this century at a time when China was charging ahead in key sectors. While Harris backed President Joe Biden's efforts to restrict Chinese access to emerging technologies, she has also supported his calls for maintaining communication and avoiding confrontation.With U.S.-China relations having recently thawed despite the deep-rooted differences that linger, Xu and other Chinese experts outlined what they saw as the potential risks and opportunities of either candidate emerging victorious in a bout viewed as one between stability and unpredictability."People in general agree that whoever will be the winner of the election, the U.S.-China relationship, obviously, is not in the best shape," Xu said. "We know that the U.S. has a very, let's say, strong policy on China."If the vice president gets elected, probably the U.S. will pursue a kind of similar policy in line with what the U.S. has right now under the Biden administration. But Trump could be a bit unpredictable, more radical sometimes."Xu noted specifically the potential impact posed by Trump's promised tariffs, as well as the "hawkish" nature of the team he may assemble for his Cabinet. The presence of hard-liners in the White House, Xu said, could lead to escalations not only on trade but also security issues over disputed regions such as Taiwan and the South China Sea."We might see more challenges in the sense of even military conflicts," he said, "or even to the point of having a full war over the Taiwan issue."China considers self-ruling Taiwan to be a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland through diplomacy or by force, if necessary. The U.S. has not maintained formal relations with Taiwan since 1979, when Washington switched diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, but has boosted political and military support to the island.Frictions have also worsened in the South China Sea, much of which China asserts falls within its maritime territory despite counterclaims from several other regional countries. Ongoing military tensions between China and the Philippines over disputed waters and land masses have been accompanied by greater engagement between Washington and Manila, which has deepened defense cooperation with the Pentagon.But Xu identified an argument for possible benefits to China in a Trump win, particularly because of how his unpredictability is often ill-received among traditional U.S. allies and partners."I would say maybe countries like China, Japan, European countries, they have something in common," Xu said. "You all have to deal with this unpredictable, powerful person in the White House. So, that may give these countries something in common. It may be easier for them to handle their relationship."At the same time, Harris is "seen as someone you can talk to, someone you can reason with," especially when it comes to areas of potential cooperation such as transnational crime, drug trafficking and climate change, Xu said. But this may come with a strengthening of U.S.-led efforts that could also harm Chinese interests in the long run."Under President Harris, you probably expect a more, let's say, well-coordinated approach or containment on China, for example, restriction of high-tech products or technology, and also a stronger alliance with the European countries, with some Asian countries, against China," Xu said. "That also makes the relationship more challenging."Tong Zhao, a formerly Beijing-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace now conducting research in Washington, described similar stakes."Harris and her senior advisors have said little about China, but Beijing anticipates that she will largely continue Biden's China policy," Zhao told Newsweek. "This would involve deepening strategic competition with China while also striving to manage it, including selective efforts to explore cooperation on issues of mutual interest."Beijing is particularly concerned that Harris would continue to prioritize collaboration with U.S. allies and friendly countries, strengthening alliances that effectively counterbalance China's expanding ambitions in the Asia-Pacific and globally."On the other hand, he argued, Trump "could further disengage from international agreements and commitments, opening up opportunities for China to expand its influence in areas where a power vacuum emerges."Such a scenario bears serious risks for Beijing, however."Beijing is wary of a potential restart of the trade war under Trump, especially as China currently faces significant internal economic challenges and has less capacity to respond than it did during Trump's first term," Zhao said. "China also expects Trump to accelerate technology and supply chain decoupling efforts, which could threaten its economic growth and indirectly impact social and political stability."A particularly concerning scenario for Beijing would be if senior officials in a Trump administration openly questioned the legitimacy of China's political system, as happened in his first term. The Chinese ruling party's past anxieties over regime security played a significant role in the rapid deterioration of the bilateral relationship."As with past U.S. elections, China has officially expressed its neutrality and willingness to work with either side."The presidential election is the domestic affair of the United States," Chinese Embassy to the U.S. spokesperson Liu Pengyu told Newsweek on Tuesday. "China, committed to the principle of non-interference in others' internal affairs, will not interfere in the U.S.' presidential election. Developing China-U.S. relations is in the fundamental interest of our two peoples and two countries and meets the expectation of the international community."No matter who is elected as U.S. president, we hope the U.S. will work with us in the same direction, follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and advance the steady, sound and sustainable growth of bilateral relations for the benefit of the two countries and the world at large."Shen Shiwei, journalist and nonresident research fellow at Zhejiang Normal University's Institute of African Studies, emphasized the importance of improving ties in either post-election scenario."The issue of strategic perception is always fundamental to the China-U.S. relationship," Shen told Newsweek. "No matter who wins the election, stabilized and constructive bilateral relations are good for both sides."We know that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Whether China and the United States have a cooperative or confrontational relationship bears on the well-being of the Chinese and American peoples."Having participated in a number of China-U.S. youth exchange programs this year, he felt that much of the "misjudgment and misperceptions" plaguing the relationship between the two nations was rooted in a lack of grassroots interaction. He called for "more on-site experiences here so they could have a better understanding of the country and bilateral relations."Andy Mok, a Beijing-based geopolitical commentator and senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, said that China was looking to pursue a more open posture regardless of who emerged victorious in the election."Regardless of whether Vice President Harris or former President Trump wins, China is committed to its path of openness," Mok told Newsweek.To illustrate this, he cited the words of Chinese Premier Li Qiang during an import expo held in Shanghai on Tuesday: "Opening up is a fundamental policy of China. No matter how the international situation changes, China will not deviate from its chosen path."This endeavor, Mok argued, could be seen in China's decision to lower its tariff rate to 7.3 percent, below even the target rate of 9.8 percent. As such, he said, "China's actions underscore its dedication to greater global engagement and trade liberalization, irrespective of U.S. electoral outcomes."Even with China looking to maintain its current strategy while dealing with either Harris or Trump, the U.S. election is seen by many as an event that could have sweeping effects on the bilateral relationship and beyond."I think it's enormous," Zichen Wang, a former journalist for China's official Xinhua News Agency now studying at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs in New Jersey, told Newsweek. "Not just the United States or China, but the entire world is watching, and it is a very close election."I don't think anybody can tell with confidence who is going to win. And it's going to have drastically different implications for not just the American people, but also China-U.S. relations and the entire world."Echoing Xu and Zhao, Wang felt Beijing had a clearer understanding of what a Harris victory would bring to the relationship, even if she has spoken less about China than her rival."Kamala Harris' position, especially in terms of China-U.S. relations, is seen as some sort of stabilization or continuity of Biden's China policy. I think it's a consensus in the Chinese expert community," Wang said. "And Donald Trump is simply too unpredictable to tell what he will implement if he wins the election."Wang took note of the view that "if Donald Trump messes up the U.S. alliances, maybe that is good for China." But he felt this was too risky of a concept to prove an advantage in practice, particularly as Washington's allies in Asia and Europe did not necessarily get closer to Beijing under the previous Trump administration."I understand there is this perception that China would prefer chaos and want to see basically the United States falling apart because of Donald Trump, and I don't think that's the Chinese consensus," Wang said, noting that such instability "doesn't really benefit anybody."Such was the case when the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the world in 2020 during the final year of Trump's presidency. Amid already deteriorating ties between Washington and Beijing, relations sunk even further as the Trump administration increasingly blamed China for the spread of the disease first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Now, Wang said he felt "Donald Trump still holds some grudge over COVID and he sort of blames China for costing him the election in 2020."Still, even with ties having somewhat stabilized under Biden, Wang said that "Beijing is not very happy with China-U.S. relations as they are." He described the dynamic as an "uncomfortable coexistence, because China believes under Joe Biden and the Democratic administration, the U.S. policy is based on wrong strategic concepts."In any case, Wang saw the most potentially volatile issue as being Taiwan, with which both Trump and Biden boosted ties during their respective tenures.Trump took the unprecedented step of receiving a congratulatory call from then-Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen upon winning the 2016 election and went on to accelerate arms sales and official visits to the island. Biden continued building informal ties and also broke with past tradition by inviting Taipei's envoy to his 2021 inauguration and repeatedly vowing to come to the island's aid in the event of a military conflict with China.In May, Tsai was succeeded by fellow Democratic Progressive Party candidate Lai Ching-te, also called William Lai, who has expressed even greater pro-independence sentiments, drawing anger from China. Washington has repeatedly argued no change in its approach to the issue, but its gradual shifts have been viewed in Beijing as a leading threat."The Chinese feeling is that the U.S. is not doing enough to restrain William Lai Ching-te," Wang said, "so hopefully there will be no wrong signals from any one of the winners of the election."Newsweek Is Committed To Journalism That'S Factual And Fair.Hold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.Based in his hometown of Staten Island, New York City, Tom O'Connor is an award-winning Senior Writer of Foreign Policy ... read more

CONTENT: Donald Trump has won the 2024 election and will be President for a second time, according to the Associated Press. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning after determining that Vice President Kamala Harris had no mathematical path to victory based on the votes tallied so far.Americans went to the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 5, to cast their ballots for the next President—along with candidates for a wide range of other federal, state, and local offices.The outcome in the presidential race hinged on seven battleground states: former President Donald Trump won Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin, while Arizona and Nevada have not yet been called.The stakes were particularly high as economic issues, immigration, and reproductive rights were top of mind for voters. And there’s the historical significance of the candidates themselves: Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, would have been the first woman and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as U.S. President. Meanwhile, Trump, who is 78, will become the oldest President in history if he finishes another term at 82, and he will be the first President convicted of a felony.Read More: How Trump WonThe cost of living remains a central concern for voters, with many Americans still grappling with inflationary pressures stemming from the pandemic. Trump positioned himself as a champion of economic revitalization, even as some economists warn that his proposed tariffs could have the opposite effect. For Harris, the issue of abortion became a rallying cry, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. She framed reproductive rights as a matter of personal freedom, resonating particularly with women voters, many of whom were mobilized by ballot initiatives aimed at protecting these rights in key states. Immigration also remains a critical issue for Trump, who has vowed to deport millions of undocumented migrants.Republicans also won control of the Senate and retained the House. Read below for TIME’s coverage, keeping you updated throughout Election Day and beyond.Nov. 13, 10:30 p.m. ETThe GOP not only regained control of the White House and the Senate but also managed to hold onto a narrow majority in the House, the Associated Press called Wednesday, more than a week after voters headed to the polls. The victory in the House will have significant ramifications for the start of Trump’s second term, allowing the President-elect and his allies to push forward with their full legislative agenda now that both chambers of Congress are under Republican control until at least 2026. Read more here. —Nik PopliNov. 9, 9:30 p.m. ETDonald Trump has officially won the Electoral College by 312 to 226, the largest margin of victory since Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012. The AP called the final state Arizona for Trump on Saturday, cementing his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in all seven swing states.The AP called the overall race on Wednesday, after Trump had won both Georgia and North Carolina and broken the so-called “blue wall” with Pennsylvania then Wisconsin, taking him over the 270 electoral-vote threshold. Battlegrounds Michigan and Nevada were later also called for Trump. See a map of the results here.Though ballots are still being counted, Trump also looks set to win the popular vote, which would make him the first Republican to do so in 20 years. Voter turnout appears on track to be close to the record high set in 2020. —Chad de GuzmanNov. 7, 9:00 p.m. ETKey political figures across the globe have been extending congratulatory messages to Trump, including Russia President Vladimir Putin, who had initially held off on reaching out to the President-elect. “I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as President of the United States of America,” Putin said during a Q&A session at a conference on Thursday. “I don’t know what will happen now. I have no idea,” he added, referencing uncertain diplomatic relations to come.On Wednesday, embattled Ukraine President Volodmyr Zelensky shared a lengthy social media post in which he said: “We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.”China President Xi Jinping also congratulated Trump, according to Chinese state media, expressing hope for cooperation rather than confrontation and urging that they “find the right way to get along in the new era, so as to benefit both countries and the wider world.”Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara addressed Trump and his wife Melania on X. “Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!” the Netanyahus wrote. “Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.”So far, leaders from more than 50 countries have also offered their congratulations on social media. Read more here. —Chad de Guzman and Rebecca SchneidNov. 7, 11:48 a.m. ETOn Thursday, President Joe Biden addressed the nation for the first time since Trump—whom Biden beat in 2020—won the presidency.Biden spoke from the Rose Garden at the White House, emphasizing that he will “fulfill his duty” as President by facilitating a peaceful transfer of power between him and Trump, and calling for the country to “bring down the temperature” and tension between those of different political parties. “Yesterday, I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory and I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team,” Biden said.He praised Harris’ character, saying she “has a backbone like a ramrod” and calling her campaign “inspiring.”After thanking poll workers and his team, he asked his supporters to not forget “all that we’ve accomplished” and reminded the country that there are 74 days left to finish his term. “Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,” he said. “We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up.” Read more here. —Rebecca SchneidNov. 7, 8:11 a.m. ETIn what has been a week of disappointment for Democrats, with the presidency and the Senate firmly in the hands of the GOP, prominent members of the party have been sharing their reactions to Harris’ election loss.Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidential race against Trump in 2016, shared a statement via social media alongside her husband, former President Bill Clinton. The couple congratulated Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance and emphasized their admiration for Harris.“We must remember that America is bigger than the results of any one election. And what we as citizens do now will make the difference between a nation that moves forward or one that falls back,” the statement read. “We need to solve our problems and seize our opportunities together. The future of our country depends on us.”Others called for continued fight and hope. New York Rep. and prominent progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressed the election loss in a video shared on Instagram, and she didn’t mask her disappointment.“This is real. And I’m not here to sugarcoat what we are all about to collectively experience,” she said. “But I think that what we can do to prepare is to build community…We are about to enter a political period that will have consequences for the rest of our lives. We cannot give up.”Sen. Elizabeth Warren also released a video on Wednesday, calling on Democrats to take “opportunities to fight back.”“They are counting on us to point fingers at each other and to lose trust in our ability to ever, ever make change. I absolutely refuse to give them that satisfaction. We will continue to fight for each other,” Warren said. —Rebecca SchneidNov. 7, 7:10 a.m. ETMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, posted a statement on X addressing the Democratic Party’s defeat. He thanked Harris for selecting him as her VP candidate and said campaigning at her side had been the “honor and privilege of [his] life.”Walz also attended Harris’ concession speech at Howard University on Wednesday evening, where he clapped and waved after Harris mentioned him by name.“To Governor Walz and the Walz family: I know your service to our nation will continue,” Harris said.Over social media, Walz reiterated similar points as Harris did in her speech, writing that the outcome of the election was not what was desired, but that their job is not done.“I am grateful to the millions of Americans who joined our campaign and stood up for our greatest ideals: decency, compassion, and love of our neighbor,” he said. “Now more than ever, we need you to continue fighting for those values and the country we all love.” —Rebecca SchneidRead More: How Far Trump Would GoNov. 6, 6:35 p.m. ETFormer First Lady Melania Trump said that she will help “safeguard the heart” of the U.S.—freedom, under her husband’s second administration.“I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security,” she wrote in a statement on X. “American energy, skill, and initiative will bring together our best minds to propel our nation forward forevermore.” —Solcyré BurgaNov. 6, 6:15 p.m. ETPresident Biden spoke with both Trump and Harris on Wednesday, according to the White House. Biden congratulated Trump on his win and congratulated Harris “on her historic campaign.”On the call with Trump, Biden “expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,” according to the White House’s description of their talk. Biden also invited President-elect Trump to meet with him at the White House “in the near future.”“President Joe Biden called President Donald J. Trump to congratulate him on his victory and extended an invitation to the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the current Administration and the incoming Administration. President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call,” said Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications DirectorBiden will address the nation on Thursday to talk about the election and the transition. —Brian BennettRead More: What Donald Trump’s Win Means for AbortionNov. 6, 6:15 p.m. ETPresident Biden released a statement Wednesday afternoon in support of Harris following her presidential candidacy loss, calling her a public servant “full of integrity, courage, and character.”“What America saw today was the Kamala Harris I know and deeply admire,” Biden said following Harris’ concession speech. “Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans.” —Solcyré BurgaNov. 6, 6:15 p.m. ETHarris conceded to Trump on Wednesday evening, in a speech at her alma mater Howard University. She focused on encouraging Americans to continue fighting for justice for all.“We must accept the results,” Harris said, emphasizing that she and President Joe Biden will engage in a peaceful transition of power. Harris said that, while she was conceding the election, her work is far from done. “While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square,” she said. “And we will also wage it in how we live our lives—by treating one another with kindness and respect.”Read more about her speech here. —Brian BennettNov. 6, 5:56 p.m. ET.In a statement on Wednesday, former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama congratulated Trump and his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance on winning the 2024 election, adding that it “is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for” but calling on the nation to come together.“Living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won’t always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power,” the Obamas said, noting that the nation’s problems are solvable “only if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.”Barack and Michelle Obama, who were powerful surrogates for the Harris-Walz campaign and rallied crowds in several swing states, added that they “could not be prouder” of the Democratic ticket, calling Vice President Harris and Minnesota Gov. Walz “two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign.” —Nik PopliRead More: What Donald Trump’s Win Means For ImmigrationNov. 6, 4:30 p.m. ETJust as Harris was set to give her concession speech, Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a searing review of the Democratic Party: “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” the independent from Vermont wrote. “First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they’re right.”The blistering statement from one of the leaders of the progressive movement comes as Democrats have begun soul-searching to determine what went so wrong for the party to lose ground with some of its most reliable constituencies. “Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” Sanders asked. “Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.”Sanders added the Democratic Party needs “to have some very serious political discussions” in the coming weeks and months.Read more about Democrats’ blame game here. —Nik PopliNov. 6, 3:54 p.m. ETThe Trevor Project reported an increase of 125% in crisis contact volume on Election Day through Wednesday morning when compared to what the organization called “normal days.” The LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention organization offers crisis services through text, phone calls, or online.“We anticipate this number will be at least maintained, and potentially only increase,” Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said. Election-related crisis conversations were on the rise prior to the election, as the Trevor Project saw a near 200% increase in crisis outreach from Nov. 3 to 4, compared to October 29 to Nov. 2. Previous research found that 90% of LGBTQ+ people reported their wellbeing was negatively affected by recent politics. A rise in anti-transgender sentiment, which has been espoused by Republican candidates, including the President-elect, has been linked to a rise in suicide attempts by transgender and nonbinary youth.NBC’s exit poll found that 86% of respondents who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender voted for Democrats. —Solcyré BurgaRead More: What Donald Trump’s Win Means for the EconomyNov. 6., 2:32 p.m. ETHarris called Trump to congratulate him on winning the 2024 presidential election, according to a senior Harris aide. She discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans.“President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory. President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country,” said Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director.The Vice President is scheduled to deliver remarks at Howard University this afternoon. —Brian BennettNov. 6, 11:35 a.m. ETIn Montana, more than 57% of voters backed a measure that will amend the state constitution to guarantee the right to abortion until fetal viability, or later if necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. About 43% of voters rejected the measure, as of 9:47 a.m. ET on Wednesday, when about 87% of the votes were counted. The AP called the race at 6:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Abortion is currently legal until fetal viability in Montana, but advocates have said that the measure would prevent future lawmakers from trying to roll back access—which they have tried to do in recent years.The abortion-rights measure in Nevada received about 63% of the vote in favor and about 37% in opposition, as of 5:09 a.m. ET on Wednesday, when about 84% of the votes were counted. The AP called the race at 3:21 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The measure would enshrine in the state constitution the right to abortion until fetal viability or after in situations where the pregnant person’s life or health is at risk, but voters will need to pass it again in 2026 before the state constitution can be changed. Nevada currently allows abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy.Overall, the 2024 election had mixed results regarding matters of abortion—measures that would protect abortion rights passed in seven states but failed in three. —Chantelle LeeNov. 6, 7:12 a.m. ETIn the first state with competing abortion ballots since the Dobbs decision in 2022, Nebraska rejected a ballot measure to expand abortion rights in the state. Voters enshrined the state’s current law which bans abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest, and to save the life of the pregnant person. The anti-abortion rights measure—Initiative 434, or the “Protect Women and Children” Initiative—was called by AP at 1:02 a.m. Wednesday.Nebraskans also voted on the “Right to Abortion Initiative,” which would have created a right to abortion until fetal viability or when needed to protect the life or health of a pregnant woman, thus overturning the 12-week ban put into place last year. At 3:27 a.m. on Wednesday, AP called that the initiative failed to pass. —Rebecca SchneidRead More: What Trump’s Win Means For CryptoNov. 6, 5:41 a.m. ETDonald Trump has won the 2024 election and will be President for a second time, according to the AP. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning after determining that Kamala Harris had no mathematical path to victory based on the votes tallied so far.Trump’s win marks a stunning political comeback for the former President and celebrity businessman after he lost in 2020 to Joe Biden and then refused to accept the results, encouraging his supporters to violently storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to try to overturn his loss.Trump, 78, campaigned with a central message that the Democrats had fumbled the economy and the border, and that he could fix it all. In the final months of his tumultuous 2024 campaign, Trump survived two assassination attempts and the FBI foiled a third plot by Iran to hire a hitman to kill him. After an assassin’s bullet grazed his ear during a rally in Butler, Pa. in July, Trump rose and pumped his fist and told the crowd to “fight.”Trump’s win makes him only the second President in American history to win back the White House four years after being voted out. It hasn’t happened since Grover Cleveland won his way back to the Oval Office in 1892 after being kicked out by voters in 1888. —Brian BennettNov. 6, 5:26 a.m. ETVoters in South Dakota rejected the proposal to add protections for abortion rights to the state constitution. South Dakota has one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans. The outcome of this vote preserves the state law that makes it a felony to perform an abortion outside of cases where it is carried out to save the life of the mother. The AP called the result at 2:49 a.m. ET Wednesday.Meanwhile, Arizona voted to approve an abortion rights amendment which guarantees abortion access up to fetal viability. The state was one of 10 with abortion measures on the ballot in the 2024 election. The AP called the result at 3:31 a.m. ET, Wednesday. The vote comes after the Arizona Supreme Court earlier this year allowed the enforcement of an 1864 law banning nearly all abortions, but the legislature swiftly repealed it. —Olivia-Anne ClearyNov. 6, 3:30 a.m. ETTrump claimed victory in his race against Harris in a late-night speech to supporters at his campaign’s election watch party event in West Palm Beach. Fla.The AP has not yet called the presidential election, though Trump has a commanding lead in several battleground states.“We’re gonna pay you back,” Trump said, thanking his supporters, before saying, “Together we can truly make America great again for all Americans.”“I will not let you down. America’s future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than it has ever been before.” —Chad de GuzmanNov. 6, 1:00 a.m. ETAs of 1:00 a.m. ET, all polls have closed. Polls closed in Hawaii and parts of Alaska at 12:00 a.m.Nov. 6, 12:52 a.m. ETHarris won’t speak tonight, according to campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond. Addressing the crowd at Howard, he said Harris would make remarks tomorrow. He also noted that “we still have votes to count” and that key states have not yet been called. —Charlotte AlterNov. 5, 11:55 p.m. ETRepublicans are likely to take control of the U.S. Senate after flipping two key Democratic-held Senate seats in Ohio and West Virginia that the AP called Tuesday night. Control of Senate will be vital for Republicans as they now look to have power over the next president’s legislative agenda, Cabinet appointments, judicial nominations, and more. Democrats faced a daunting challenge to defend their slim 51-seat majority, with 34 contested seats up for election.

The AP called the result at 11:24 p.m. ET. Nearly 54% of voters backed the measure, while about 46% rejected it, with about 77% of the vote counted by 11:29 p.m. ET.Missouri has one of the strictest laws restricting abortion in the country, but the newly-passed measure is expected to supersede the state’s current near-total ban. Abortion rights advocates celebrated the news Tuesday night, with Center for Reproductive Rights President and CEO Nancy Northup calling it “an especially historic win for Missouri.”“By saying yes to this powerful language, voters have demanded the return of the essential human rights and freedoms they lost after Roe was overturned,” Northup said in a press release. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 11:12 p.m. ETLate Tuesday night, the Harris campaign sees her likeliest path to victory going through the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, according to a memo by Harris campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon obtained by TIME. “While we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states,” the memo reads, calling it “a razor thin race.” The memo suggests the Harris camp also does not believe the election will be called tonight. —Brian BennettNov. 5, 11:00 p.m. ETAs of 11:00 p.m. ET, polls have closed in California, Washington, and the rest of Idaho and Oregon.Nov. 5, 10:50 p.m. ETAbortion-related ballot measures have passed in three states so far.Voters in Maryland overwhelmingly decided to guarantee the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution. The AP called the result at 9:28 p.m. ET, with about 74% voting in favor and 26% voting against the ballot measure after about 54% of the votes were counted.Abortion is already legal in the state until fetal viability, or after that if necessary to protect the pregnant person’s life or health, or if the fetus has a serious abnormality. But abortion-rights supporters have said that the amendment will ensure that future lawmakers can’t restrict access to abortion in the future.In New York, voters also decided to amend their state’s constitution. A measure to include equal rights protections, such as a provision that no person should be discriminated against because of “pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy,” passed, according to an AP call at 9:31 p.m. ET. About 72% of voters backed the measure and only about 27% rejected it after about 34% of the votes were counted as of 9:51 p.m. ET. Abortion is allowed until fetal viability in New York.Colorado will enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution, after the AP called the result at 10:26 p.m. ET, with about 56% of votes counted and nearly 61% of voters backing the ballot measure and only about 39% of voters rejecting it.. Colorado already allows for abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and the measure was widely expected to pass. The newly-passed amendment will also repeal a nearly four-decade-old ban on state and local government funding being used to pay for abortion services. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 10:25 p.m. ETDelaware State Sen. Sarah McBride, already the nation’s highest-ranking openly transgender elected official, made history once again on Tuesday, becoming the first openly transgender person elected to the United States Congress. She clinched Delaware’s lone House seat in a resounding victory, according to the AP.While her win is a landmark moment for the transgender community, McBride, 34, was careful not to make her identity the centerpiece of her candidacy. “I’m not running to be the trans member of Congress,” McBride says in a sit-down interview with TIME in Dover, Del. two weeks before the election. “I’m running to be the best damn legislator that I can be.”Her historic win comes at a time when transgender rights are under siege and the political discourse surrounding LGBTQ+ issues has reached new levels of polarization.

The measure, which needed 60% of the vote to succeed, fell just short. The AP called the result at 9:06 p.m. ET., with about 57% of Floridians voting in favor and 43% voting against it, with about 91% of the votes counted.The result in Florida on Tuesday breaks a previous trend—before this year, voters had sided with abortion rights every time the issue has been on state ballots since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Because the Florida amendment failed to pass, the state’s six-week abortion ban will remain in effect.The campaign behind the ballot measure held a press conference Tuesday night after the result was announced. Campaign director Lauren Brenzel said the vote breakdown showed that, while the measure failed to pass, the majority of Floridians backed it.“They are tired of women dying because of abortion bans. They are tired of women being forced to give birth to children who died in their arms because of abortion bans,” Brenzel said. “A bipartisan group of voters today sent a clear message to the Florida Legislature.”Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup said in a press release Tuesday night: “Like so many Americans, Floridians are living under an abortion ban they didn’t ask for and don’t want. As the majority of Florida voters made clear tonight, they want their reproductive freedom back. But due to the high 60% threshold and the state’s disinformation campaign, they must continue to live with the fear, uncertainty, and denial of care caused by the reversal of Roe. So too will countless women in the southeastern U.S., which will remain for now a virtual abortion desert.”Anti-abortion groups, meanwhile, celebrated the result. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America’s President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a press release that the news was “a momentous victory for life in Florida and for our entire country.” Nine other states had abortion-related measures on the ballot on Tuesday, but Florida was the first to release results in the closely-watched race. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 9:10 p.m. ETNew Jersey Rep. Andy Kim is set to become the first Korean American to be elected to the U.S. Senate after winning the seat of former Sen. Robert Menendez, who was convicted on corruption charges earlier this year.  The 42-year-old Congressman, who has served as a representative for New Jersey’s 3rd district since 2019, was elected over first-time Republican Curtis Bashaw. New Jersey has not elected a Republican Senator for more than 50 years.Kim’s road to the Senate was not an easy feat. To win the Democratic primary, Kim rallied against Tammy Murphy, spouse of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who had the support of some Democratic party leaders. “We just won our Senate race! As a son of immigrants, a public school kid, I never could’ve imagined I’d get to serve as a US Senator. I’m deeply humbled and grateful to NJ and for everyone who got us here,” Kim wrote in an X post Tuesday evening. “I promise I’ll serve with honor and integrity as a public servant for all.” Kim is now one of just three Asian American U.S. Senators. —Solcyré BurgaNov. 5, 9:06 p.m. ETRepublican Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson lost the race for North Carolina Governor to the state’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, according to the AP. Robinson has a history of controversial remarks—a September CNN investigation linked Robinson to dozens of inflammatory and racist comments on a porn forum. October polls showed Stein holding a consistent double-digit lead ahead of Robinson.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) won a second term on Tuesday, the AP called, besting his Democratic opponent former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in a closely-watched Senate race and further cementing how reliably red the former swing state has become.Scott, 71, served two terms as Florida governor before he was first elected to the Senate in 2018 by a razor-thin margin that necessitated a recount. In polls before the 2024 election, Scott was only narrowly ahead of Mucarsel-Powell, a 53-year-old, Ecuador-born, one-term Democratic congressperson for South Florida.Scott is among the richest U.S. senators, and has reportedly pumped millions of his own money into his campaign. Scott’s election victory in Florida positions him to potentially succeed Mitch McConnell, as he plans to run for Senate Republican leader in the incoming Congress. —Chad de GuzmanNov. 5, 8:30 p.m. ETAs of 8:30 p.m. ET, polls have now closed in Arkansas.Nov. 5, 8:00 p.m. ETAs of 8:00 p.m. ET, polls have now closed in Alabama*, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania*, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., as well as portions of North Dakota, Kansas, and Texas, depending on the time zone.*Some locations in Alabama and Pennsylvania will remain open later.Nov. 5, 8:00 p.m. ETTrump will be joined at his Mar-a-Lago club on Election Night by Elon Musk, according to a campaign official, as well as his running mate J.D. Vance. —Eric Cortellessa/Palm Beach, Fla.Nov. 5, 7:55 p.m. ETAfter Trump posted on social media on Election Day, “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!,” Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner responded, saying the Republican nominee has no evidence to back this up.“The only talk about massive cheating has come from one of the candidates, Donald J. Trump. There is no factual basis whatsoever within law enforcement to support this wild allegation,” Krasner said in a statement on X. “We have invited complaints and allegations of improprieties all day. If Donald J. Trump has any facts to support his wild allegations, we want them now. Right now. We are not holding our breath.”Trump followed up with another post on Truth Social, again without evidence: “Philadelphia and Detroit! Heavy Law Enforcement is there!!!”CNN reported that the Philadelphia Police Department did not know what Trump may have been referencing and was unaware of any voting issues that would require a law enforcement response. City Commissioner Seth Bluestein also said in a post on X that there was “absolutely no truth” to Trump’s election fraud claim: “It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure.”

Detroit officials have also told CNN that they were unaware of “any police presence in the city for elections beyond what was outlined in a press conference last Thursday and widely reported nationally.”Trump has begun to sow doubt in the integrity of the election as observers warn that he may contest the results if he loses. Pennsylvania and Michigan are two of the seven swing states that may decide the race. —Chad de GuzmanNov. 5, 7:50 p.m. ETWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice won the state’s open Senate seat, the AP called Tuesday night, moving Republicans one step closer to flipping the balance of power in the Senate. Republicans were heavily favored to win the seat after Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent who left the Democratic Party, decided not to seek re-election and endorsed Democrat Glenn Elliott, the former mayor of Wheeling.With Justice’s win in red West Virginia, Republicans now only need to flip one more seat to win control of the Senate under a Democratic presidency. —Nik PopliNov. 5, 7:34 p.m. ETThe Harris campaign says they’re seeing strong signs of enthusiasm among students, with long lines at universities in North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

The threats are suspected to be tied to “foreign enemies,” including Russia. But officials stressed that no voters or voting locations are at risk. Threats, some of which have also been tied to Russia, have also been reported in Georgia, which extended voting hours at several polling locations in Fulton and Gwinnett County past the 7 p.m. scheduled closing time. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 5:48 p.m. ETThe Harris campaign is seeing reasons for both optimism and caution as they head into Election Night. They say they’re seeing high Puerto Rican turnout in Philadelphia. (A comedian at a Trump rally last week made a racist joke about Puerto Rico.) They’re also seeing enthusiasm among college students, particularly in Pennsylvania. However, the Harris campaign also says Republican turnout in Florida appears high. —Charlotte AlterNov. 5, 5:12 p.m. ETFor months leading up to Election Day, Republicans and Democrats have been facing off in court over dozens of voting-related lawsuits. The ripple effects of those cases could be far-reaching. Trump is already highlighting the lawsuits and rulings as a way to undermine confidence in the result if he loses. Democrats have been working to block those lawsuits and stave off last-minute attempts by some election officials to narrow how votes are counted and certified. Harris’ legal team is working to make sure that all eligible votes are counted and that election officials with political motivations don’t try to prevent or delay certification of the outcome. Republicans have managed to successfully challenge voter registrations in Virginia and Arizona and restrict which mailed ballots can be counted and when in Pennsylvania and Mississippi.Read more about the legal cases that could make a difference once the polls close here. —Brian BennettNov. 5, 5:26 p.m. ETA man who smelled like gasoline and was carrying a torch lighter, a flare gun, and papers he intended to deliver to Congress was arrested Tuesday afternoon at the Capitol Visitor Center, authorities said.Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said authorities were interviewing the suspect, and added that the Israel-Hamas war “may” have been one of the reasons he attempted to enter the Capitol. “It’s really unknown at this point what his intention was,” Manger said. “There’s no indication right now that it had anything to do with the election.”The man appeared to hesitate as he was going through security, Manger said. When he put his belongings on a conveyor belt for a security screening, Capitol Police members saw “something in the shape of a firearm” and “two bottles in the backpack,” the police chief said, adding that they noticed a “faint odor of gasoline” on his body and on the backpack.It’s unclear if the man intended to set himself on fire, Manger said. “He had some articles in his backpack that he may have wanted to set on fire,” he said, although “it did not appear that he had doused all of his clothing” in the substance that smelled like gas.Police closed the Capitol Visitor Center for tours while police investigated the incident. Congress was not in session today and it is not a voting center. There are 34 contested seats up for election in the Senate, and all 435 seats in the House are on the ballot. —Nik PopliNov. 5, 4:36 p.m. ETGoogle has clarified misconceptions around its voting information feature, after Elon Musk and X users raised concerns of election interference related to the different search results that would appear when users looked up information on voting for the two candidates. Google’s voting information service, launched in 2012, uses search and maps to provide information on how and where to vote. On Tuesday afternoon, Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a prominent Trump supporter, quote-tweeted a post in which Google results for the search “Where can I vote for Trump” yielded election-related stories, while the search “Where can I vote for Harris” displayed a map where searchers could insert their address and find their polling location.In a response, Google said that the map was triggered because Harris’ name is the same as a county in Texas. “The “where to vote” panel is triggering for some specific searches bc Harris is also the name of a county in TX. Happens for “Vance” too bc it’s also the name of a county,” Google said in a post on X. “Fix is coming. Note very few people actually search for voting places this way.” —Simmone ShahNov. 5, 4:23 p.m. ETThe FBI said on Tuesday it was made aware of at least two instances of its name and insignia being used to spread false election-related information. One manipulated video, which was a fake news clip, circulating online shows the FBI allegedly asking citizens to vote remotely because of “high terror” threats at polling stations. “This video is not authentic and does not accurately represent the current threat posture or polling location safety,” the FBI said in a statement. A second fabricated video shows a fake FBI press release that says that five prisons in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona colluded with a political party to manipulate inmate voting.“Election integrity is among our highest priorities, and the FBI is working closely with state and local law enforcement partners to respond to election threats and protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,” the Bureau added. —Solcyré BurgaNov. 5, 4:00 p.m. ETThe presidential election isn’t the only close race to watch tonight. The battle for control of Congress is shaping up to be equally competitive as Democrats and Republicans hope to flip the House and Senate, respectively. Control of both chambers will likely come down to a handful of critical races across key states. The Democrats face a daunting challenge in the Senate, with their slim 51-seat majority looking increasingly at risk as 34 contested seats are up for election. Republicans are expected to pick up the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, meaning they would need just one additional victory to reclaim control of the chamber provided they manage to avoid any upsets elsewhere.The key races that determine control of the Senate are in Ohio, Montana, Texas, Nebraska, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Maryland, and Florida. You can read more about these races here. The party that controls the Senate will have power over the next President’s legislative agenda, Cabinet appointments, judicial nominations, and more. —Nik PopliNov. 5, 3:45 p.m. ETAfter Trump voted in Palm Beach, Fla. on Tuesday, he was asked twice about the state’s abortion-rights ballot measure. At first, he evaded the question, saying only that he did “a great job bringing it back to the states,” in reference to how he nominated three of the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. When asked about the Florida ballot measure again, Trump said, “You should stop talking about it.”The measure in Florida is one of the most closely-watched abortion-related initiatives this year. The state currently prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many people know they’re pregnant, and carries some exceptions. If it passes, the measure would effectively upend Florida’s current restriction, enshrining the right to abortion up until fetal viability—or later if necessary to protect the pregnant person’s health—in the state constitution. Trump had initially suggested that Florida’s six-week ban was too strict and indicated that he would vote in favor of the measure, but later said he would vote “no.”After he cast his ballot, Trump said he was feeling “very confident” about the presidential race. “It looks like Republicans have shown up in force,” he said to reporters. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 2:41 p.m. ETThere are 10 states that have abortion-related measures on the ballot in the 2024 election—the highest number in a single year. Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota will decide whether to amend their state’s constitution to include protections for reproductive rights. Nebraska, meanwhile, is the first state to have two competing abortion initiatives on the same ballot since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in 2022—one measure would enshrine in the state constitution the right to abortion until fetal viability or later if needed to protect the pregnant person’s health, while the other would amend it to incorporate a ban on abortion in the second and third trimesters, with exceptions for rape, incest, or medical emergencies.Five of the states voting on the issue—Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota—currently restrict or ban abortions. If their abortion-rights measures pass, that would effectively upend those restrictions.So far, voters have sided with abortion rights every time the issue has been on the ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Before this election, seven states—California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio—had put abortion on the ballot after the Dobbs decision. —Chantelle LeeNov. 5, 1:06 p.m. ETBomb threats that caused disruptions at polling places at the Etris Community Center and Gullatt Elementary in Union City, Georgia have been deemed non-credible, according to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. “We’ve heard some threats that were of Russian origin. I don’t know how to describe that that’s viable—we don’t think they are, but in the interest of public safety, we always check that out, and we’ll just continue to be very responsible when we hear about stuff like that,” Raffensperger told reporters Tuesday. “We identified the source, and it was from Russia.”Law enforcement was present at the five to seven precincts that were impacted by the threats, Raffensperger added, though only two precincts stopped voting. Other counties temporarily postponed voting for some 30 minutes while officials dispelled the threat. Fulton County, where the bomb threats were made, is looking to extend voting hours due to the disturbance. Georgia voters can check their polling places wait times online. —Solcyré BurgaNov. 5, 1:54 p.m. ETAhead of her election night event at Howard University in Washington, DC, Harris spent the morning calling into battleground state radio stations to encourage Americans to vote, according to her campaign. She called into Power 99 in Philadelphia, KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh, The Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, and Foxy 107.2 in Raleigh, N.C. Harris continued her election day radio call-ins with calls to radio stations in Milwaukee and Nevada, along with Phoenix-based Radio Campesina Network. She said that she will be having dinner with her family this evening.—Charlotte AlterNov. 5, 10:47 a.m. ETTrump is expected to vote in person on Election Day before noon. He will be joined by his wife, Melania, and 18-year-old son, Barron, at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, Fla., according to sources familiar with Trump’s plans. This will be Barron's first time voting in the General Election.Trump will watch the returns with his top aides, friends, and family at his Mar-a-Lago club, according to sources familiar with his plans. His campaign is hosting an election night watch party down the road at the Palm Beach County Convention Center. Trump is expected to address the crowd at some point in the evening. Some within his orbit are bracing for the possibility that Trump will prematurely declare victory, much like he did in 2020, setting in motion a potential legal showdown over the election outcome in the coming days and weeks if he loses. —Eric Cortellessa/Palm Beach, Fla.Nov. 5, 9:42 a.m. ETEarly voters have already broken records at their local polling stations in numerous states, including Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, and North Carolina. In Louisiana, more than a million early and mail-in votes were cast prior to Election Day, compared to the nearly 820,000 cast in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.There has been an improvement in early vote numbers for Republicans, who have taken to the practice under the encouragement of Trump, after he spent years questioning the integrity of early and mail-in ballot voting.Other states like Wisconsin have already surpassed their absentee voting totals from the last presidential election. In Minnesota, more than 1.1 million absentee ballots (and ballots for Minnesota precincts that exclusively vote by mail), were accepted as of Nov. 1. Some 1.9 million absentee ballots were cast in the state in 2020, compared to 677,000 in 2016.Absentee voting allows citizens to vote even if they will be out of their municipality on Election Day, or if they have a disability or illness that bars them from being able to vote in-person. It differs from early voting, which allows people to vote in-person before Election Day. Eight states, including Arizona, Maine, and New Jersey, allow any voter to sign up to receive an absentee ballot, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while others—like Louisiana—limit absentee voting to seniors or those with permanent disabilities. —Solcyré BurgaNov. 5, 7:00 a.m. ETThough polls will close at the end of the day on Nov. 5, there might not be a clear winner on Election Day. As voting by mail continues to be a popular option, the counting and verification of mail-in ballots could lead to delays—especially in a close race. Counting mail-in ballots involves additional layers of processing and verification; in some states, the work begins when ballots are received, while in other states, counting begins on Election Day.Some swing states will see results sooner than others: Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina have pre-processing laws that ensure the mail ballots are processed and verified ahead of Election Day. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, however, prohibit processing and verifying mail-in ballots before polls open on Election Day. (In 2020, it took four days for election results to be called in Pennsylvania.) And Arizona and Nevada, which both vote largely by mail, are likely to be the last to see results come in. —Simmone ShahNov. 5, 7:00 a.m. ETPolling hours vary state by state—sometimes even county by county. On TIME’s map below, you can see when exactly the polls in your state close today. Since poll closing times vary in North Dakota and New Hampshire, you can utilize search functions on each state’s respective website.The first polls will close in Kentucky and Indiana at 6 p.m.—specifically those districts in the Eastern Time Zone.How long it will take to get results from each polling station will vary greatly. For some states, like Arizona, most votes are likely to be cast via mail and early voting. Whereas in key swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, counters are not allowed to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day. —Rebecca SchneidCONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election.For the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity.“Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month.And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign.“Madame President” would be a new thing for America and it’s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving.The Harris campaign won’t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is “hidden sexism” here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president.It’s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who’ll tell a pollster outright that they don’t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there’s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not “ready” or doesn't have the right “personality” or “what it takes,” what they really mean is that the problem is she’s a woman.The Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. “Kamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he’s confident Trump will win because “the male gender gap gives us the edge”.Last time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign’s slogan “I’m with Her” was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role.Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton’s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, ‘There’s just something about her.’She says she soon realised that “It was about the ‘her.’ That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.”While Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, “there are certain people who just think ‘A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.’”A lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination.But those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they’d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles.A gender gap has opened in the race, CBS News poll results released Sunday indicate, reflecting broader attitudes in the US about societal roles.CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported that men are more likely to say efforts to promote gender equality in the US have gone too far; they are more likely to be Trump supporters.Women are more likely to say those efforts haven't been enough - and they tend to support Harris.Men also are less likely than women to think Harris will be a strong leader, CBS reported, and a majority of men say they think Trump will be a strong leader.So for some voters, this November’s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men.“Young men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,” says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics.“Frustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask ‘what about us?’”Della Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they’re your neighbour’s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard.Della Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than their female counterparts: they are less likely to be in relationships, they are less likely to enrol in college than they used to, they have higher rates of suicide than their female peers.Young American women meanwhile are steaming ahead. They are better educated than men, they work in service industries that are growing and increasingly they are earning more than men. In the period since Donald Trump was elected president, young women have also become significantly more liberal than young men, according to the Gallup polling group.Which is all creating a stark gender split. Over the last seven years, the share of young men who say the US has gone “too far” promoting gender equality has more than doubled, according to the American Enterprise Institute.With his almost intuitive grasp of people’s dissatisfactions, Trump has tapped into that male frustration, and in the final weeks of his campaign he has doubled down on masculinity. He reposted a warning on Truth Social claiming “Manhood is Under Attack.” Recently he joked about a famous golfer’s genitalia.“This is a guy that was all man,” said Trump, referring to golfer Arnold Palmer. “When he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there – they said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable.’”Trump took the locker room talk out of the locker room - and his audience loved it. Riffing about penis size at a political rally, it was the ultimate pushback against stifling political correctness.In their rallies, and on the airwaves, the Democrats’ response to disaffected men seems to be a dose of tough love. Barack Obama scolded that some men “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” In a new TV ad, Actor Ed O’Neill was a little snappier but more direct: “Be a man: Vote for a woman.”In the final days of this campaign, gender is everywhere - and nowhere.Donald Trump wants manhood front and centre of this race. Kamala Harris barely acknowledges she is a woman running for office. In a New York Times poll, Trump leads with male voters by 14%. Harris leads women by 12%.Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls - they may well decide this election.Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Democrat Ruben Gallego has beaten Republican Kari Lake in their closely watched US Senate race in Arizona, the BBC's US partner CBS News projects.Gallego, a 44-year-old Iraq War veteran who has served in the US House of Representatives, has a lead of about two points over Lake, 55, a former news anchor and an outspoken ally of Donald Trump.The contest came two years after Lake - who denies that Trump lost the 2020 presidential election - lost the Arizona governor race; a result she also challenged.Gallego's win represents some solace for Democrats, in a swing state that went against them in the presidential election, and in the overall battle for control of the Senate.Gallego will become the first Latino to represent Arizona in the US Senate, replacing independent lawmaker and former Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.The battleground state of Arizona had not elected a Democratic US senator for 30 years before Sinema won her seat, followed by fellow Democrat Mark Kelly, who won John McCain's seat in 2020 after he died.Having entered politics with progressive positions, Gallego was observed by pundits to be running on a more moderate platform in 2024.He emphasised his military background, and promised to lower rising costs and to fix a "broken" immigration system in the border state.Lake, meanwhile, frequently attacked Gallego's personal life, including the criminal background of his estranged father. She consistently trailed Gallego in the polls leading up to the race.Next year, the Republican Party will take control of the Senate, or upper chamber of US Congress, with a narrow majority.Meanwhile, they are a handful of seats short of winning majority control of the House, or lower chamber - though several races remain too close to call.He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.The Desperate Housewives star acknowledged most Americans were not as "privileged" to "get to escape".The man told officers he "accidentally stepped on the gas too hard" driving the vehicle into a pool.A public pressure campaign by top Donald Trump allies to elect their preferred candidate, Florida Senator Rick Scott, failed.The 70-year-old liberal justice plans to stay on the bench, as Donald Trump accuses Democrats of rushing to appoint judges.

CONTENT: Supporters of Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump react as he speaks at a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on October 27, 2024 in New York City.On Sunday afternoon, to kick off the last full week of the 2024 presidential campaign, thousands of people lined up under a screen several stories high with the image of former President Donald Trump.

They were waiting outside New York's Madison Square Garden where Trump was holding a campaign rally.

It was a homecoming of sorts for the man who has portrayed himself as the quintessential New Yorker.

The headliner took the stage two hours after he was scheduled to, and before that...more than two dozen others spoke.

Many leaned into racist, misogynistic and vulgar rhetoric, like comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who now famously referred to Puerto Rico as a "floating pile of garbage"

There was intense backlash, and a Trump campaign advisor later put out a statement distancing the former President from Hinchcliff's remarks.

But Hinchcliffe wasn't the only speaker who used incendiary language during the rally Sunday night.You're reading the Consider This newsletter, which unpacks one major news story each day. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to more from the Consider This podcast.More key voices at the eventTrump's childhood friend David Rem referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as the devil, calling her the "antichrist."

And Stephen Miller, a policy advisor in the Trump White House and current senior campaign advisor underscored the former President's anti-immigrant message, saying "America is for Americans and Americans only."

Other speakers included Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Phil McGraw – better known as Dr. Phil.

Finally, more than four hours into the program, Trump took the stage and spoke for another 78 minutes – repeating many of the themes his warm up acts had touched on, promising some of the following:Trump referred to his opponent as a "train wreck," and promised the following: "This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country."Closing up his campaign.The rhetoric from this rally has generated plenty of conversation online for the fate of Trump's campaign. How was it received?

NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben says the fallout following the Puerto Rico comment was immediate, starting before the rally was even over.

"You had New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, who were doing an online event for the Harris campaign already. They played that clip and reacted with disgust as they heard it. Not only that, but pretty immediately, the Harris campaign itself quickly retweeted a clip"

Republican politicians, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Congressman Carlos Gimenez, also criticized that joke.

"And the Trump campaign got the message in a statement late last night. The campaign's senior adviser, Danielle Alvarez, said, 'This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,'" added Kurtlzeben.

So, does she expect the campaign to be affected by this?

"What's been remarkable in this absolutely wild election year is that almost nothing has shifted the polls, aside from the Democrats swapping candidates. Besides that, it's been remarkably stable: assassination attempts, Trump saying immigrants are vermin poisoning the blood of the nation...Nothing seems to budge."

And while it is unusual for the Trump campaign to backtrack on just about anything, it might be too close to say if it could impact the final result of the election.This episode was produced by Brianna Scott.

CONTENT: WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 19: Rudy Giuliani stands next to a map during a press conference about various lawsuits related to the 2020 election, inside the Republican National Committee headquarters on November 19, 2020 in Washington, DC.Election day is almost here, and we could soon find out who will become our next president.

But winning doesn't only happen at the ballot box, and the results of this election are already being litigated in court. It conjures memories of the 2020 election, with former President Donald Trump claiming he was the real winner, saying,

"We think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen like this."

Trump and his allies filed a slew of lawsuits alleging widespread fraud. These efforts failed. But four years later, they are already trying to employ the same strategies again.You're reading the Consider This newsletter, which unpacks one major news story each day.

Already, there have been dozens and dozens of lawsuits filed that challenge how elections are run in this country.
Jessica Marsden is the director of impact programs for free and fair elections at Protect Democracy, who says a large of number of these suits have to do with attempts to disenfranchise voters on the basis of eligibility.

"One is we've seen a number of suits from the RNC and affiliated conservative organizations challenging voter eligibility, saying, in essence, that there are a number, thousands in some cases, of voters who are registered to vote who shouldn't be. Whether that be because they are non-citizens or there's some other issue with their eligibility. "

Marsden says other suits also have to do with overseas voting. Just in the past few weeks, she says there have been cases filed in North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania challenging those states' procedures for allowing overseas citizens, including members of the military, to participate in the election this fall.So, what does Marsden believe the strategy is attempting to get at? Filing lawsuits early so they'll have a better chance of succeeding than they did in 2020.

"Many of those cases were dismissed by courts because the cases were brought too late. You can't wait until after an election to challenge a voter's eligibility to cast his or her ballot. So it seems likely that by filing some of these cases now, even though they don't stand a chance of getting relief before the election, the RNC may be readying to make some of those same arguments after the election and hoping that the existence of these earlier suits somehow helps their cause then."

Democrats have also been involved in election litigation. But Marsden says that they have filed significantly fewer cases, with a large focus of theirs serving as interventions against the Republican suits.

"The Democrats have been bringing fewer cases than the Republicans this year, and often they are intervening in cases that were initially brought by Republicans. So you do end up with the two parties on opposite sides of a lawsuit. But one unusual thing this year is that I think we've seen more of these cases coming from Republican groups."This episode was produced by Karen Zamora, with audio engineering by Valentina Rodríguez Sánchez and Zo vanGinhovenSponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: O
n Friday afternoon, with only a few days left in the presidential race, the federal agencies that help safeguard American elections issued a warning to voters about a video that had been circulating online. It appeared to show immigrants voting illegally in Georgia, and U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that it was the latest in a series of fakes produced by “Russian influence actors.”“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,” read the statement from the FBI and two other federal agencies, who warned that Russia would continue creating and spreading these fakes even in the weeks and months after the elections.For anyone who lived through the last two presidential ballots, the statement may have seemed familiar. Eight years have passed since the 2016 U.S. election was tainted with disinformation attributed to Moscow, and the government has not found a way to deter this kind of meddling. Instead the problem has gotten messier.China and Iran now use the same tactics in trying to influence U.S. voters, while the number of these operations linked to the Kremlin has multiplied over the past eight years from two to more than 70, says Clint Watts, the head of Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center, which tracks and often exposes foreign influence operations. “They now have thousands of people working in this space,” he says of the Russians.A long list of government agencies are working to counter these threats, ranging from the FBI to more obscure bureaucracies like the USPIS, which deals with mail crime. When I reached out to three of them to talk about election interference, they all pointed me to an agency within the Department of Homeland Security known as CISA — the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which co-authored Friday’s statement alongside with the FBI.Charged with securing everything from the electric grid to the banking system from malicious cyber attacks, CISA also often takes the lead in protecting U.S. elections. Its short history says a lot about the difficulty of its mission. Organized in response to the Russian influence operation of 2016, the agency’s first director, Christopher Krebs, was fired by then-President Trump for publicly defending the integrity of the election Trump lost in 2020. (Krebs learned of his dismissal via a presidential tweet.)Republicans in the House have since tried unsuccessfully to slash CISA’s budget. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has accused the agency of trying to censor political speech, and there is growing concern among Democrats that Trump would gut the agency if he wins the presidential race.The controversy has put CISA in an awkward spot. Alongside its mission of securing election infrastructure, it has been forced to deal with a “firehose of disinformation” aimed at the American public, says Cait Conley, a senior adviser at CISA working on election security. The agency’s response, she says, “is to flood the zone with accurate information.”CISA’s director, Jen Easterly, has gone on a media tour to reassure voters that the outcome of the ballot can be trusted. Last year the agency also launched a podcast called CISA Live, whose monthly episodes offer the same message alongside discussions of Chinese cyber threats and advice on what gadgets to buy as gifts for the holidays. On YouTube, they rarely get more than a thousand views, far less than the roughly 3000 people who work at CISA.Now consider what they’re up against. According to an analysis by the Washington Post, more than two dozen of the most popular podcasts in the country have amplified claims that the upcoming election will be rigged. The main source of that message has been Trump, who has never backed down from his claims that the 2020 elections were stolen from him. His ally in the current race is Elon Musk, the owner of a social network where much of our political discourse plays out.“A lot of times we try to blame some of that distrust on foreign threat actors, but the reality is that particular narrative is very much home grown,” says Olga Belogolova, an expert on disinformation at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “It might be amplified by foreign threat actors, Russian, Chinese, Iranian,” she says. “But those narratives are disseminated by U.S. officials and candidates.”Since 2016, Americans have grown more receptive to them. One survey conducted last year by Monmouth University found that two out of three Republicans believe voter fraud determined the results of the vote in 2020. Another poll, released this month by NPR, PBS News and Marist, found that a majority of Americans are worried about voter fraud in the current ballot, including 86% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats.After the 2016 presidential election, Belogolova worked on the Trust and Safety team at Facebook, trying to identify and disrupt Russian disinformation agents on the platform. She describes it as a game of Whack-a-mole, with new accounts appearing to replace those that had been removed. The work seemed useful but also frustrating, she says, because her team took down fakes without offering anything in their place. “You have to find ways to tell stories that are compelling to people, so that they have something to believe in,” she says. “I think that’s the task right now.” In trying to meet that challenge, CISA has tried to amplify reliable sources of information. In the middle of October, it reacted to a fake video that appeared online, showing the destruction of what appeared to be mail-in ballots for Trump. State election officials took only a few hours to debunk the video, and the FBI blamed Russian actors for producing it. A few days later, with only a week to go before election day, CISA launched a “one-stop-shop” website to expose fake videos and other forms of disinformation.Watts, the threat analyst at Microsoft, says such rapid reactions help to slow the spread of these clips online, as news outlets are quickly able to identify them as fake. But they can still rack up millions of views on social media, because plenty of Americans are willing to share them. While government agencies have gotten more effective in responding to election interference since 2016, the American public has become more suspicious about the conduct of elections.That challenge to the democratic process could prove a lot more difficult to handle. As Watts puts it: “That’s all about restoring trust over time.”CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Every four years, we hear a refrain that the presidential election before us is the "most important election of our lifetimes." This line is reflexively repeated by pundits, talkers, and thinkers on both sides of the American political divide, and that repetition always engenders a great deal of backlash. We are reliably informed that our elaborate Constitution, with its intricate checks and balances and federalist system of dual spheres of sovereignty, can withstand any particular president (and Congress). Bills are very hard to pass out of Congress, you see, and rogue presidents can be reined in by the Supreme Court. Didn't you know that gridlock in Washington is a feature, not a bug? Don't you remember watching "Schoolhouse Rock!"? Come on!I dissent from this blithe dismissal of very real concern. Tuesday's presidential contest, between former President Donald Trump and sitting Vice President Kamala Harris, is the most important election of our lifetimes. There are two reasons for this: one structural and one contextual. They are both important.First, structure. There is a concept in traditional Jewish thought called yeridat hadorot, or "the decline of the generations." The basic idea is that, because each successive generation is necessarily further away than the generations that preceded it from God's Revelation to Moses at Mount Sinai, each new generation is less reliable than its predecessors when it comes to Torah knowledge, divine inspiration, and perhaps general wisdom. We can draw an easy analogy here to the American republic. With the exception of some truly epochal figures, such as Abraham Lincoln, subsequent generations of American leadership that are further removed from the Constitutional Convention of 1787 have been less reliable when it comes to safeguarding core American values. We see this clearly, for instance, in the early 20th-century rise of the modern administrative state.From this perspective, every new presidential election is the most important one of our lifetimes. By definition, we are always getting further and further away from the American Founding, and closer and closer to the point of no return (if we have not already crossed it).This Tuesday's particular presidential election is also the most important election of our lifetimes for a simple additional reason: Harris is the most ideologically left-wing, intellectually deficient, and wildly unprepared presidential candidate in the nation's history.An America under (God forbid) President Harris is an America besieged with so many illegal alien criminals and foreign terrorists so as to make the last four already-horrific years look positively paradisical. An America under (God forbid) President Harris is one where American manufacturing continues to deteriorate, stifling electrical vehicle mandates destroy the American auto industry, oil and natural gas restrictions lead to skyrocketing energy prices, and mass spending once again brings crippling inflation. An America under (God forbid) President Harris is one where the Supreme Court is packed, the lower courts are stacked with radical Constitution-hating progressives, and the Department of Justice is weaponized like never before against Democrats' political enemies. An America under (God forbid) President Harris is one where Iran gets the bomb, jihadism is emboldened both at home and abroad, China invades Taiwan and makes ever-greater inroads in our own hemisphere, and Israel is as diplomatically and militarily isolated as it has ever been.Are you paying attention yet?This is not your grandfather's Democratic Party. Once upon a time, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court, his fellow Democrats who dominated the Senate Judiciary Committee had the common sense and decency to rise up en masse and say, "No." But today, a President Harris would have supine leftist zealots, such as Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), eager to do the bidding of their dear White House leader. Once upon a time, Democratic former President Bill Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and vowed that abortion would be "safe, legal, and rare." Today, Harris says she will brook no compromise on religious exemptions for the fundamental "right" of snuffing out an unborn life in the womb, and she promises to codify that "right" from conception right up until birth nationwide.I repeat: Are you paying attention yet?Ultimately, the 2024 election presents us with the opportunity to pick a definitive side in America's roiling cold civil war, which this column has often phrased as that between the forces of civilizational sanity and the forces of civilizational arson. Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) represent the former: They are the ticket, above all, of normalcy. Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), by contrast, embody the latter: They are the ticket, above all, of decadence. It is not an exaggeration to say that our constitutional structure, biblical inheritance, and middle-class economy are all on the ballot this Tuesday.Here's hoping team sanity prevails over the arsonists.Josh Hammer is Newsweek senior editor-at-large, host of "The Josh Hammer Show" and "America on Trial with Josh Hammer," a syndicated columnist, senior counsel for the Article III Project, and a research fellow with the Edmund Burke Foundation.

CONTENT: With less than a week to go until election day and early voting well underway, most polls suggest the 2024 presidential race is about as close as it gets.Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are currently separated by razor-thin margins in the vital swing states. National polls indicate that the race is very much a toss-up.But some experts are more certain of the outcome than others. Here are five prominent election forecasters with their takes on who will win the 2024 presidential election.Historian Allan Lichtman uses a system of 13 true/false statements to determine who he believes will win the presidency.Known as "The Keys to the White House," this model evaluates the standing of the incumbent party based on a variety of factors, including the economy, domestic politics, and foreign policy.If six or more are false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose the election. Should five or fewer be false, it is expected to win.In September, Lichtman formally predicted that Harris would win the 2024 election.Speaking to Newsweek, the American University professor said that foreign policy was the most difficult area to evaluate, due to the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East."You're dealing with two wars—two uncertain wars that are very fluid—which makes those two keys extremely difficult to call," he said.Statistician, writer, and poker player Nate Silver wrote in an October 23 opinion piece for The New York Times that his "gut says Donald Trump" will win.Silver stressed, however, that his official forecast model, which draws on polling data, suggests the race is essentially a toss-up."I don't think you should put any value whatsoever on anyone's gut—including mine. Instead, you should resign yourself to the fact that a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50," wrote Silver, who founded and formerly edited the election analysis site FiveThirtyEight.French economist Christophe Barraud has been referred to as the most accurate economist in the world.Chief economist and strategist at Market Securities Monaco, Bloomberg ranked him the top U.S. forecaster every year except once since 2012.According to Barraud, his model, which draws mainly on economic and financial data, suggests the most likely outcome of the election is a Trump win with a Republican sweep. He expects the GOP to win the Senate, but the House could go either way.Thomas Miller is a data scientist from Northwestern University who uses betting markets to make his predictions rather than traditional polls, which he says don't accurately capture shifting voter sentiments."I don't rely on polls. I rely on prediction markets," Miller previously told Newsweek. "A political prediction market is a leading indicator of what will happen in an election. People are putting their money down, which means they believe something's going to happen in the future."Miller, who accurately forecast the 2020 presidential election, also considers historical trends from previous elections to balance the data with what he calls "fundamentals," a common practice for election modelers.In September, his model pointed to a landslide victory for Harris but has more recently shifted in favor of Trump, projecting a possible 345 Electoral College votes for the Republican.Larry Sabato is an American political scientist, analyst, and editor-in-chief of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political site that forecasts and tracks numerous political races, including for the presidency.The site's ratings consider electoral history, polling, candidate quality, modeling, and reporting.At the time this article was written, Sabato's Crystal Ball's 2024 Electoral College ratings did not point to a clear victor.Its projections suggest 226 votes for Harris and 219 for Trump, with 93 votes considered toss-ups. 270 Electoral College votes are needed to secure the White House.Do you have a story we should be covering?
