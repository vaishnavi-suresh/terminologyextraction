CONTENT: A Donald Trump impressionist has said his phone did not stop ringing after the result of the 2024 US presidential election.Mike Osman, a comedian from Southampton, was almost ready to retire his blonde wig and fake tan.But news of the Republican's return to the White House has inspired him to carry on.After launching his act in 2016, he now describes himself as the UK's number one Trump impersonator.With more than 16 million views on TikTok, Mr Osman has spent years working on his act, named Donald Trumped.Despite having a southern English accent, the comedian seems to imitate Trump's voice with ease."The first thing you've got to do is get the wig - and you've got to get it right," he said.The impressionist wears a bespoke hairpiece created by wig designers, which is regularly re-styled by a hairdresser.Next is perfecting the costume, in particular Trump's suit and iconic crimson tie."The tie is about eight foot long," he joked, adding his seamstress neighbour had made it especially for him.But the most important part of being a Donald Trump impersonator, he said, was replicating his eyes and mouth."I have watched a lot of videos of Donald, believe me," he added.The morning after the presidential election in November, Mr Osman said demand for his act was high."I'm non-political, I have no axe to grind doing Donald Trump, the American people have decided," he said."I'm the UK's number one Donald Trump impersonator - interestingly, I'm in the top five in the world, according to a survey."Mr Osman grew up on a council estate in Millbrook, a suburb of Southampton."Nothing wrong with that," he said."But if you'd have said to me when I was growing up in Millbrook that I would be the top five in the world at anything, you know, I'd have taken that."President-elect Donald Trump will take office in January.You can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.The line towards Bournemouth is blocked and trains are unable to run.The president-elect said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on China on his first day in office.The 1960s aircraft is set to be transformed after Solent Sky Museum salvaged it from a scrapheap.The emergency department at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth promises a "better experience" for patients.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.

CONTENT: The US will still continue fighting climate change and curbing its emissions of planet-warming gases despite the election of Donald Trump, the US special envoy told the COP29 conference on its opening day.John Podesta, a Biden administration appointee, labelled the incoming president a climate denier and said he would dismantle environmental safeguards.But in a sign of some early progress, country representatives struck an agreement over a long-standing sticking point in international climate negotiations.The move could allow richer countries to make up for some of their atmosphere-heating pollution by investing in clean energy projects or forests in developing nations.The election of Trump last week was a worrying development for action on climate change, as least in the short term experts have said.“He has vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement," Mr Podesta said.“That is what he has said, and we should believe him."The 2015 Paris agreement saw countries agree to try to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C.Leaders from nearly 100 countries will address the meeting in the coming days.COP29 had been billed as an opportunity to solve the crucial issue of getting money to poorer countries to help them deal with the impacts of climate change and help them prepare for it.But expectations for what the summit can achieve have been lowered by a Trump victory that makes Biden administration negotiators from one of the world's largest carbon emitters a lame duck in this process and unable to really promise much.However, the election wasn’t the end of the struggle, Mr Podesta told reporters.He believed that as a result of the policies put in place by President Biden and with the support of states and cities, US emissions would continue their downward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace.“The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle and one country. This fight is bigger still because we are living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world."As evidence that countries will continue to make progress on the issue, in the absence of leadership from the US, delegates signed off the final and most controversial component of the Paris climate agreement late on the first night of COP29.It means that a global 'carbon market' can now been established, allowing richer nations to pay for projects in developing nations that reduce emissions and use this to meet their climate obligations. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas released by human activities.This proposal is very attractive to richer countries in Europe as it is far cheaper to pay for a wind farm somewhere in Africa, for example, than to subsidise heat pumps at home.Agreed over this had proved very tricky. There have been concerns about fraud and whether the carbon removals are real and permanent.And despite it being passed some of those concerns remain, but supporters say it could unleash a flurry of market activity, worth up to $250bn a year flowing from rich to poor.As a reminder to negotiators of the urgency of the situation there was fresh scientific gloom. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in a report released to coincide with the conference's start, that 2024 is on track to be the world’s warmest year on record.Its latest State of the Climate report also finds that our oceans are heating up rapidly and glacier melt is accelerating.“We are on the road to ruin,” Mukhtar Babyaev, president of COP29 said in his opening remarks.He went on to list examples of climate impacts now around the world, saying “these are not future problems” as rising temperatures were doing huge damage around the world right now.The mood of delegates wasn't improved by the scale of the main task facing negotiators here.Amid energy and economic crises, developed countries are expected to find billions extra in climate finance for developing nations.Richer countries are willing to increase their contributions, as long as major emerging economies like China and the Gulf states also chip in.UN climate change chief Simon Stiell said that two thirds of the world cannot afford to cut emissions quickly enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold alive.If they didn’t get the cash to cut their carbon, everyone suffers, he said.“Let's dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity. An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest,” he told delegates.One issue exercising the minds and pockets of attendees at this gathering is the price of food and drink in the conference centreOur colleague Aygul Mehman, a journalist with the BBC’s Azerbaijani service, was charged 41 AZN (the Azerbaijani currency) for her modest lunch of soup, a bean salad and a dry roll. That’s about £18 ($24)."It’s like they are taking money from our pockets," one delegate told BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt as he was queuing up for food.This is a serious issue. Delegates from poorer nations often complain about how much these big conferences cost them when you add in flights and hotels and the total can come to many thousands of pounds.It hoped to provide direct flights to destinations like the east coast of America and the Middle East.After being absent for more than a century, salmon have been spotted in Oregon's Klamath River Basin, following a mammoth dam removal project in California.The international centre, opening on Monday, will focus on sharing knowledge and providing training.The new deal offers $300bn (about £240) a year to developing nations by 2035.The Samoan chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States explains why some of developing nations left the talks in Baku.

CONTENT: Donald Trump's return to the White House will have a hugely negative effect on climate change action in the short-term but the longer term impact is less certain, experts say.With world leaders meeting next week for the latest UN climate talks, COP29, the Trump victory will be seen as a huge roadblock to progress in both cutting emissions and raising cash for developing countries.The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a "scam".But with renewable energy gaining a strong foothold in the US and popular support for wind and solar, Trump's efforts to ramp up oil and gas instead may be less effective.While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change. The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration."The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck," said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute."They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything."In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute."The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook," Prof Klein said.Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.This was ratified by the US Senate, almost unanimously, in 1992. Legal experts are unclear on the process of leaving the treaty, but any effort by the US to leave would be seen as a body blow to the principle of multi-lateral action to tackle the world's greatest threat.As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China."You are looking at, overall, a 'drill baby drill' philosophy," Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC told Bloomberg News."You are going to see offshore lease sales, you are going to see pipelines move much quicker, you are going to see fracking on federal lands and a mindset that is focused on lowering energy costs for consumers."There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.But in the longer term, it is not clear if the new president will turn back the clock for coal, oil and gas, or curtail the growth of sustainable energy sources.For a start he faces opposition - and notably from within his own party.Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.According to one analysis, some 85% of the money has been in areas that elected Republicans.With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.Climate leaders are putting a lot of faith in the fact that the transition to green energy will not be derailed by the new Trump administration."The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action," said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief."But it cannot and will not halt the changes under way to decarbonise the economy and meet the goals of the Paris agreement."Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.Outside the UK?

CONTENT: In the build-up to Tuesday’s US election, claims of voter fraud flooded social media - but as Donald Trump’s victory crystallised, the chatter largely subsided.The claims didn’t stop entirely, however. A number of right-wing influencers and organisations pushing stories about “cheating” and a “rigged” vote pointed to incomplete vote totals and continued to repeat discredited theories about the 2020 election.And disappointed Democratic Party supporters developed their own unsubstantiated voter fraud theories, some of which went viral on X, formerly Twitter, and other platforms.The reach of the posts is nowhere near the deluge of content that circulated after Trump lost the 2020 election.And with no support from losing candidate Kamala Harris or other Democratic Party officials, the chances seem slim of a large-scale movement developing along the lines of the “Stop the Steal” drive four years ago, which culminated in a riot at the US Capitol.The BBC tracked a huge wave of pre-election fraud claims that carried through election day and into the evening.These included claims of the vote being “stolen” in some key swing states, with exaggerated takes on real events being used in some cases to bolster the allegations.Early on election day in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold, there were problems with voting machines malfunctioning. The issues were fixed and voting hours in the affected areas were extended.However, many online immediately used the story to suggest nefarious activities were taking place.One post at 08:45 local time on Tuesday said: “The election steal is happening!”Other rumours were spread in posts that popped up throughout the day, including one at around 14:00, which claimed ballots in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, had been pre-marked for Kamala Harris.In Milwaukee, the biggest city in the swing state of Wisconsin, elections officials made a decision to re-run around 30,000 ballots out of an “abundance of caution”, after doors on the back of voting machines were left open.Once the count was completed, it showed that support for Harris had dropped compared with Joe Biden's four years earlier.Like many of the pro-Trump posters, Harris supporters pointed to real but isolated events - fires at ballot drop boxes in Washington and Oregon, and a series of fake bomb threats that disrupted voting at several polling locations on election day - as evidence of widespread voter fraud.However, there’s no evidence that the incidents significantly altered the vote or changed the outcome.Several posts from Democratic Party activists questioning the result went viral and were seen by millions on X and other platforms.Pam Keith, a Harris supporter in Florida, posted: “Is it possible that the machines were hacked to switch the tallies from Harris to Trump?” Her message was seen more than one million times on X, according to the site’s metrics. The BBC has reached out to her for comment.Unlike Trump’s campaign in 2020, however, the Harris campaign and top Democratic Party officials have not endorsed allegations of cheating or voter fraud.On election day, fraud rumours also came from President-elect Trump himself, who has repeatedly argued from the outset of his political career that the voting system is unfairly stacked against him.Just after 16:30 Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!”The now president-elect did not give any details and the Philadelphia Police Department told BBC Verify they were not aware of what Trump was referring to.Seth Bluestein, the Republican City Commissioner in Philadelphia, posted on X: "There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure."Trump has not repeated the fraud allegations since election day.We have contacted several hugely influential accounts that regularly posted about election fraud claims in the build-up to the vote, but none of them replied.With data firm NodeXL, the BBC tracked accounts that engaged with Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Elon Musk on X around election day.Posts mentioning vote fraud peaked at 15:00 EST on 5 November - but then dropped off significantly that evening and into the next day as polls closed and results came in.However, some organisations and activists who promoted voter fraud allegations in the past continued to repeat debunked rumours even after the results became clear.Emerald Robinson, a former reporter with right-wing TV networks and a pro-Trump influencer with more than 750,000 followers on X, insisted that Democrats were “cheating right now” and posted: “I always told people the voting machines were rigged!”More generally, reaction from pro-Trump groups and influencers who previously hyped up vote fraud claims varied - from silence on the issue, to continued insistence that the 2020 vote was marred by fraud.The BBC contacted Ms Robinson for comment.In another case, a chart that was widely circulating online claimed to show a sharp drop-off in vote totals in 2024 compared to 2020.Many are pointing to the figures as “proof” of fraud.Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, a Trump supporter who has pushed voter fraud theories, posted the day after the election: "Kamala got 60 million votes in 2024. Does anyone really believe Biden got 80 million in 2020? Where did those 20 million Democratic voters go? The truth is, they never existed."However, the chart and the figures circulating online were based on preliminary vote totals, which continue to go up as final results are still being tabulated.Already, Harris has more than 69 million votes in her column - with Trump on more than 73 million. As of Friday, fewer than two million ballots have yet to be counted nationally, in states including Arizona and California, according to Reuters.The BBC contacted Mr D'Souza for comment.Those same numbers are also fuelling conspiracy theories from supporters of Harris, who are wondering where their “missing” voters are - and ignoring the fact that turnouts and preferences frequently shift, often dramatically, between elections.Partisans on both sides are also pointing to differences in vote tallies for Harris and other Democrats running for Senate seats.But there is no requirement for US voters to support candidates from just one party, and “ticket-splitting” - voting for candidates from different parties in different races - although becoming rarer, is fairly common in American politics.The University of Florida’s Election Lab turnout tracker is showing slightly lower turnout in 2024 as compared to 2020 - 62.5% v just over 66%.Additional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh and Merlyn ThomasWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: When US President Joe Biden walked through Kyiv in February 2023 on a surprise visit to show solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, air sirens were wailing. “I felt something… more strongly than ever before,” he later recalled. “America is a beacon to the world.”The world now waits to see who takes charge of this self-styled beacon after Americans make their choice in next week’s presidential election. Will Kamala Harris carry on in Biden’s footsteps with her conviction that in “these unsettled times, it is clear America cannot retreat”? Or will it be Donald Trump with his hope that “Americanism, not globalism” will lead the way?We live in a world where the value of US global influence is under question. Regional powers are going their own way, autocratic regimes are making their own alliances, and the devastating wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere are raising uncomfortable questions about the value of Washington’s role. But America matters by dint of its economic and military strength, and its major role in many alliances. I turned to some informed observers for their reflections on the global consequences of this very consequential election.“I cannot sugarcoat these warnings,” says Rose Gottemoeller, Nato’s former deputy secretary general. “Donald Trump is Europe’s nightmare, with echoes of his threat to withdraw from Nato in everyone’s ears.”Washington’s defence spending amounts to two-thirds of the military budgets of Nato’s 31 other members. Beyond Nato, the US spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia.Trump boasts he’s playing hardball to force other Nato countries to meet their spending targets, which is 2% of their GDP - only 23 of the member nations have hit this target in 2024. But his erratic statements still jar.If Harris wins, Ms Gottemoeller believes “Nato will no doubt be in good Washington hands.” But she has a warning there too. “She will be ready to continue working with Nato and the European Union to achieve victory in Ukraine, but she will not back off on [spending] pressure on Europe.”But Harris’s team in the White House will have to govern with the Senate or the House, which could both soon be in Republican hands, and will be less inclined to back foreign wars than their Democratic counterparts. There’s a growing sense that no matter who becomes president, pressure will mount on Kyiv to find ways out of this war as US lawmakers become increasingly reluctant to pass huge aid packages.Whatever happens, Ms Gottemoeller says, “I do not believe that Nato must fall apart.” Europe will need to “step forward to lead.”The next US president will have to work in a world confronting its greatest risk of major power confrontation since the Cold War.“The US remains the most consequential international actor in matters of peace and security”, Comfort Ero, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, tells me. She adds a caveat, “but its power to help resolve conflicts is diminished.”Wars are becoming ever harder to end. “Deadly conflict is becoming more intractable, with big-power competition accelerating and middle powers on the rise,” is how Ms Ero describes the landscape. Wars like Ukraine pull in multiple powers, and conflagrations such as Sudan pit regional players with competing interests against each other, and some more invested in war than in peace.America is losing the moral high ground, Ms Ero says. “Global actors notice that it applies one standard to Russia's actions in Ukraine, and another to Israel's in Gaza. The war in Sudan has seen terrible atrocities but gets treated as a second-tier issue.”A win by Harris, she says, “represents continuity with the current administration.” If it’s Trump, he “might give Israel an even freer hand in Gaza and elsewhere, and has intimated he could try to cut a Ukraine deal with Moscow over Kyiv’s head.”On the Middle East, the Democratic candidate has repeatedly echoed Mr Biden’s firm backing of Israel’s “right to defend itself.” But she’s also made a point of emphasising that “the killing of innocent Palestinians has to stop.”Trump has also declared it’s time to “get back to peace and stop killing people.” But he’s reportedly told the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what you have to do.”The Republican contender prides himself on being a peacemaker. “I will have peace in the Middle East, and soon,” he vowed in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya TV on Sunday night.He’s promised to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords. These bilateral agreements normalised relations between Israel and a few Arab states, but were widely seen to have sidelined the Palestinians and ultimately contributed to the current unprecedented crisis.On Ukraine, Trump never hides his admiration for strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He’s made it clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine, and with it the US’s hefty military and financial support. “I’ll get out. We gotta get out,” he insisted in a recent rally.In contrast, Harris has said: “I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine. And I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war.”But Ms Ero worries that, no matter who’s elected, things could get worse in the world.“The biggest shock to the global economy for decades.” That’s the view of leading China scholar Rana Mitter regarding Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariffs on all imported Chinese goods.Imposing steep costs on China, and many other trading partners, has been one of Trump’s most persistent threats in his “America first” approach. But Trump also lauds what he sees as his own strong personal connection with President Xi Jinping. He told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board he wouldn’t have to use military force if Beijing moved to blockade Taiwan because the Chinese leader “respects me and he knows I’m [expletive] crazy.”But both leading Republicans and Democrats are hawkish. Both see Beijing as being bent on trying to eclipse America as the most consequential power.But Mr Mitter, a British historian who holds the ST Lee Chair in US-Asia relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School, sees some differences. With Ms Harris he says, “relations would likely develop in a linear fashion from where they are now.” If Trump wins, it’s a more “fluid scenario.” For example, on Taiwan, Mr Mitter points to Trump’s ambivalence about whether he would come to the defence of an island far from America.China’s leaders believe both Harris and Trump will be tough. Mr Mitter sees it as “a small group of establishment types favour Harris as ‘better the opponent you know.’ A significant minority see Trump as a businessman whose unpredictability might just mean a grand bargain with China, however unlikely that seems.”America and... the Middle EastThe latest episode of the Global Story looks at what a Trump or Harris presidency could mean for violence in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding region.Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside the UK, listen wherever you get your podcasts.“The US election is hugely consequential not just for its citizens but for the whole world because of the pressing imperative of the climate and nature crisis,” says Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.“Every fraction of a degree matters to avert the worst impacts of climate change and prevent a future where devastating hurricanes like Milton are the norm,” she added.But as Hurricanes Milton and Helene raged, Trump derided environmental plans and policies to confront this climate emergency as “one of the greatest scams of all time.” Many expect him to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement as he did in his first term.However, Ms Robinson believes Trump cannot stop the momentum now gathering steam. “He cannot halt the US energy transition and roll back the billions of dollars in green subsidies... nor can he stop the indefatigable non-federal climate movement.”She also urged Harris, who still hasn’t fleshed out her own stance, to step up “to show leadership, build on the momentum of recent years, and spur other major emitters to pick up the pace.”“The outcome of the US election holds immense significance, given the unparalleled influence the United States wields, not just through its military and economic might, but through its potential to lead with moral authority on the global stage,” says Martin Griffiths, a veteran conflict mediator, who, until recently, was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.He sees greater light if Harris wins, and says that “a return to Trump’s presidency marked by isolationism and unilateralism, offers little but a deepening of global instability.”But he has criticism, too, for the Biden-Harris administration, citing its “hesitancy” over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.Aid agency bosses have repeatedly condemned Hamas’s murderous October 7th assault on Israeli civilians. But they’ve also repeatedly called on the US to do much more to end the profound suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as in Lebanon.Biden and his top officials continually called for more aid to flow into Gaza, and did make a difference at times. But critics say the aid, and the pressure, was never enough. A recent warning that some vital military assistance could be cut pushed the decision until after the US elections.The US is the single largest donor when it comes to the UN system. In 2022, it provided a record $18.1bn (£13.9bn).But in Trump’s first term, he axed funding for several UN agencies and pulled out of the World Health Organisation. Other donors scrambled to fill the gaps – which is what Trump wanted to happen.But Griffths still believes America is an indispensable power.“In a time of global conflict and uncertainty, the world longs for the US to rise to the challenge of responsible, principled leadership... We demand more. We deserve more. And we dare to hope for more.”BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

CONTENT: After all the drama of a campaign like no other, US election day is here. It’s been an ultra-close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and more twists and turns are guaranteed after polls close on 5 November.So settle in, and buckle up. Our election night guide includes the key things to watch out for as we wait to get a result - however long that wait proves to be. Timings below are given in GMT first and then in US Eastern time (EST).After months of second-guessing what the American public will decide, at 17:00 EST (22:00 GMT) we got an early glimpse into their thoughts and motivations, with early exit poll data suggesting democracy and the economy are the most important issues for voters.American exit polls work differently to those in the UK. Rather than predicting the result, they give an insight into people’s priorities and opinions  - and later, into how different demographic groups voted. Pollsters combine election day interviews with telephone polling both nationally and in the seven swing states.Throughout the night, expect experts to talk a lot about these states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In most states the outcome of the presidential vote is all but certain but voting in swing states is hard to predict and can lean Republican (red) or Democrat (blue). Both campaigns have been heavily targeting voters in these battleground areas that could hold the keys to the White House.By 00:00 GMT (19:00 EST), polls will be closing in Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, but these are not swing states, so the results will be predictable.But voting will also close in the first swing state of the night, Georgia. Victory for either candidate could give a strong hint at which way the election could go.Georgia was only narrowly won by Joe Biden last time. It also became the subject of false claims by Trump, who is accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his 2020 defeat.The candidate with more votes than any other in Georgia will get 16 crucial votes out of 538 under the electoral college system.Harris and Trump both want to gain a majority of 270 electoral college votes to win the White House. That matters more than the "popular vote" or the nationwide support they receive.Soon afterwards, at 00:30 GMT (19:30 EST), polls close in three more states including in North Carolina.Away from the presidential contest, there's been huge interest in the state governor contest that pits state Attorney General Josh Stein against Trump-backed candidate Mark Robinson, whose campaign has been hit by scandals.Polls close at the same time in Ohio, where Trump's running mate JD Vance is a senator. Meanwhile, the two campaigns will be gathering at their headquarters for the evening – which we know will be in West Palm Beach, Florida, in Trump’s case. Harris is expected to spend some of the night at Howard University in Washington DC, where she was once a student.At this point, some states might start to be “called” by US media outlets. They use models to project, or call, which way a state has voted, even before the full vote count has been completed.This happens when they believe a candidate has gained a lead that cannot be beaten by their opponent. In some closely-fought swing states, this could take a long time.The models the media outlets use draw on a variety of data, such as exit polls and actual votes counted by officials. The BBC gets this data from a firm named Edison Research.At 01:00 GMT (20:00 EST), more polls close - including in critical Pennsylvania, the biggest prize of the 2024 swing states with 19 electoral votes. This is where Trump survived an attempt on his life when a gunman opened fire at his rally, killing one person.It's also a state that's part of the Rust Belt - areas once dominated by manufacturing that have experienced industrial decline in recent decades. Here, a handful of counties, like Erie and Northampton, could end up making a difference.Around now, at 01:30 GMT (20:30 EST), we expect to get more exit poll data - including a national breakdown of voting by age, race, and level of college education. This is provisional data that's refined over a period of weeks.Polls close at 02:00 GMT (21:00 EST) in more closely-watched battleground states including Michigan and Wisconsin. Michigan is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the US, for many of whom the Israel-Gaza war is an important electoral issue. The state was won by Biden last time, as was Wisconsin, which this year hosted the Republican National Convention.Polls also shut in Arizona - a focal point for the nation’s immigration debate - followed by Nevada, where both parties have tried to appeal to working-class voters by vowing to end taxes on tips, an hour later.At 04:00 GMT (23:00 EST), polls close across the remaining states that adjoin each other on the US mainland. The last two states close slightly later - Hawaii at 05:00 GMT (00:00 EST) and Alaska at 06:00 GMT on Wednesday (01:00 EST).Traditionally, it was soon after the close of voting at 23:00 EST in California that the race as a whole was called for one candidate or the other. A concession speech from the losing candidate followed not long later.But few observers are expecting a speedy resolution this year, with some suggesting it could take days, rather than hours, to know the victor.In recent elections, an increased number of postal votes has tended to delay the process. Tens of millions of people have also voted early, ahead of polling day. And different states have different rules on when they start tallying them.Early tallies may also be deceptive. A candidate who takes an early lead through in-person votes may end up being overtaken when postal votes and other types of ballots are added later. This happened in Michigan in 2020. Trump took an early lead through in-person votes but was later overtaken by Biden.Despite so much focus on the presidency, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress, who pass laws and initiate spending plans. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election. In the Senate, where members vote on key appointments in government, 34 seats are being contested.Republicans currently control the House, while Democrats have the Senate.These two chambers can act as a check on White House plans if the controlling party in either chamber disagrees with the president.Voters in Montana, Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota will also be asked how their state should regulate abortion, which has become one of the election's most emotive issues.If you're still up, well done for making it this far, but there's a chance we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out who has won. The tighter the race, the more vote-counting that will need to happen before a winner can be projected in any given place - and there is always the possibility of recounts. The full nationwide count usually takes days or weeks.To give you a flavour – in 2020, the result in Pennsylvania and Nevada was projected four days after election day, and in Arizona, after more than a week by most outlets.A very close contest could feel like a repeat of 2020. Or 2024 could be comparable to the 2000 presidential race between George W Bush and Al Gore, which was disputed and ultimately settled in the US Supreme Court, with Bush certified as the winner.The neck-and-neck vote predicted by the polls and pundits in 2024 could potentially leave the door open to legal challenges by either side.That would make the night only the beginning of the drama – rather than the final word on the 2024 election.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president - after a decisive victory that will send him back to the White House.His defeated opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, urged her supporters to accept Trump's win, and insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power.He will be the first former president to return to office in more than 130 years, and - at 78 - the oldest man ever elected to the role.Trump has already been congratulated by world leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the UK's Keir Starmer, but the official presidential election results are not yet confirmed.There had been fears that extremely close races in some of the key battleground "swing" states might have left the results uncertain.But earlier-than-expected wins in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, coupled with victories in solidly Republican states, meant Trump reached the magic 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.CBS, the BBC's broadcasting partner in the US, projected Donald Trump as the overall winner just after 05:30 EST (10:30 GMT) on 6 November, the day after the election.However, it could still take days or even weeks for the detailed election results to be confirmed officially in every state.No. Trump becomes the president-elect, and his running mate JD Vance becomes the vice-president elect.Trump will be sworn in at the presidential inauguration on Monday, 20 January 2025, at which point he legally assumes the power and responsibilities of the presidency.After winning the 2016 election. Trump was sworn in as president in January 2017 and served until 2021.Once every valid vote has been included in the final results, a process known as the electoral college confirms the election result.In each state a varying number of electoral college votes are up for grabs. It is securing these – and not the backing of voters themselves – that ultimately wins the presidency.Generally, states award all of their electoral college votes to whoever wins the popular vote, and this is confirmed after meetings on 17 December.The new US Congress then meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president. As the outgoing vice-president, Kamala Harris will preside over this process.It was this meeting of Congress, to certify the election results, that Trump's supporters tried to stop, when they marched on the US Capitol in 2021 after Trump refused to concede defeat to Joe Biden.Trump and Vance will work with their transition team to organise the handover from President Biden’s outgoing administration.They will identify their policy priorities, start vetting the candidates who will take up key roles in the new administration, and prepare to take over the functions of government.At his victory rally, Trump hinted that the former Republican presidential candidate and vaccine sceptic Robert J Kennedy could be given a healthcare role.Tech billionaire Elon Musk is also expected to feature in the new administration. Trump previously said he would ask Mr Musk to tackle government waste.Trump and his team will also begin receiving classified national security briefings covering current threats and ongoing military operations.The president-elect and vice-president-elect also receive mandatory protection from the US Secret Service.Trump's team says he has accepted a traditional invitation from Biden to visit the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the administrations.The outgoing president also typically attends the inauguration of the incoming president, although Trump chose to boycott the 2021 event.Trump did, however, follow the tradition begun by Ronald Reagan of leaving a handwritten note in the Oval Office for his successor to read.At the time, President Biden told reporters that his predecessor had left "a very generous letter”.After the inauguration, the new president begins work immediately.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Hollywood actress Eva Longoria has revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain.In an interview with French magazine Marie Claire for its November cover story, Longoria attributed the decision to the country's "changing vibe" after the Covid-19 pandemic, homelessness and high taxation in California, and the re-election of Donald Trump.She also acknowledged she was "privileged" enough to move, saying: “Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country."The Desperate Housewives star is viewed as a power broker for women and Latinos in Democratic Party politics.With a keen interest in immigration policy, she has been visibly involved with Democratic candidates at the national and local level since at least 2012.She spoke at the Democratic National Convention and hit the campaign trail on behalf of Kamala Harris this year, with a tagline for the 2024 presidential candidate that adopted the "Si se puede" slogan ("Yes it's possible" in Spanish) from 1970s Latino-led farm-worker protests into the phrase "She se puede".In her Marie Claire interview, published on Thursday, Longoria described being dispirited at Trump's victory over Harris last week.“If he keeps his promises, it’s going to be a scary place," she said.She added that Trump's win in 2016 had crushed her belief that "the best person wins" in politics.“I had my whole adult life here,” Longoria said of Los Angeles, adding that “it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now”.Longoria is a ninth-generation Texan who moved to California in her twenties. In 2006, she earned a Golden Globe nomination in her starring role as Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives.More recently, she has hosted the CNN mini-series Searching for Mexico and Searching for Spain.She is married to José "Pepe" Bastón, her third husband and the president of Mexican broadcaster Televisa.The couple share a six-year-old boy, Santiago, while Bastón also has three children from a previous marriage.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: The 2024 presidential election is the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which protected the national right to an abortion.The gender divide has been prominent in this election, with polls suggesting Kamala Harris has an advantage among women and former President Donald Trump is enjoying a similar lead among men.The BBC has been speaking to women voters about how they are considering gender and abortion as they cast their ballots in the final days of the campaign.Michelle works as a quality engineer in Arizona. The 38-year-old is a registered Republican, but plans on voting for Kamala Harris.I'm concerned about women's rights and women's health care. I'm not a one-issue voter, but that is a huge one. I work in the medical sector and I was very personally affected by the overturn of Roe v Wade because I wasn't able to get access to a lot of the drugs I needed. Nobody was sure of what the legality was... even though they're used for other things.The whole Republican stance is smaller government and don't let government make my personal decisions, so why are they trying to legislate what a woman can do with her body?[A Harris presidency] would mean that all the things that my parents told me when I was younger were true - that just because you're a girl doesn't mean that you are limited.This nurse practitioner from Texas voted for Trump during the last presidential election and plans to back him again.[Trump] has definitely said things that he probably should have unsaid. I would have to shake my finger at that, especially as a woman, but I have yet to hear anything that would make me change my mind about my vote.I'm not voting personality. I'm voting policy. I don't have to marry the man. I don't have to deal with him. I have to deal with his policies.On abortion, [Harris] is not giving a gestational parameter of how late somebody can get an abortion. That cannot be-open ended. I was a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] nurse for 17 years... I care about women's rights. I care about women. The mother is the first patient. However, that is the turn-off to me that she won't give an answer to that.This Democrat from Illinois plans to vote for Harris on election day. She previously backed the Democratic ticket in 2020, voting for Joe Biden.I am definitely concerned about the direction that reproductive rights are going in parts of the country. I feel that Trump's attempts to communicate that he understands why [reproductive rights] is an important issue to women has fallen woefully short.I think Harris has an innate understanding of its importance, just being a woman and a woman of colour. Would I like her to lay out her plans a little bit more to potentially expand reproductive rights? Absolutely. But Trump has set the bar so low that she could really continue to not even mention it and she would still be doing a better job.[A Harris presidency] brings tears to my eyes just to think about. I have a nine-year-old daughter and she's old enough to start having aspirations and to start paying attention to the world around her.This library assistant voted for Trump in 2020, but now remains undecided and is considering "writing in" a candidate - casting a vote for someone who is not officially running.This ain't my first rodeo and I've gotten to the point in my life where I can look past the advertising they're doing for two specific groups.It's wonderful that we have Harris as a female seriously running for the presidency and that she has been a vice-president and has some experience. But Trump, when he was in office, I wasn't too upset with what he was doing.I wouldn't mind having a female president but some of Harris's political doctrine and what I think is right don't line up.Angela is a graduate student in Iowa. A Democrat, she backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris.I really would love this to be a moment of celebration as we elect a woman of colour to our highest office, but unfortunately with how tight the election is against Trump and how disappointing [Harris's] campaign has been on some of the issues that matter to me, it's been hard to be as celebratory as I'd like.Obviously abortion is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm not necessarily happy, I should say, with either candidate's approaches in addressing the issue.I understand Harris has a policy where she wants to codify Roe v Wade, but I think women's rights and issues extend outside of just abortion access. Trump is very wishy-washy on the issue of women's rights, so it's hard to pin him down on any stance.This retired Republican who plans on voting for Trump. She also backed the former president in 2020.I think [Trump] is really the only possibility because I think Harris is just clueless and incompetent. I think she would be a disaster for this country, just listening to her mumble and evade. I just get a horrible feeling about her.I am pro-choice, actually, within reason. Not a late-term abortion. I don't agree with that. But I think Trump by really relegating [legislation] to the states themselves, he's being sensible.Harris doesn't have much to run on so that's her big selling point with women. She doesn't have much substance to her, in other words, so she just hammers on and on about the abortion issue.This independent voted for Biden in the 2020 presidential election and voted by mail this year supporting Harris.Reproductive rights for women are huge for me as a woman, especially living in the state of Florida where there is an amendment on the ballot that will guarantee the protection for abortion rights.I really want to support a party that's going to support reproductive rights for women and not just women, but for everybody, because what's to say it's not going to spread elsewhere? It starts with women, usually, but it goes on and on.Our government is at least 50 years behind the times for a lot of things - especially other countries throughout the world having better representation. I have a niece that I love dearly. The fact that she could see [a female president], and just for that to be a normal thing for her, will be huge.This independent voter from Georgia describes herself as a left-leaning moderate. Because of her faith and anti-abortion views, she's not supporting Harris or Trump this year.I was actually going to vote for Harris, but then she started doubling down on how abortion is reproductive health... I'm a Catholic. I am pro-life.The problem that I ran into is that I don't know how any Catholic can vote for somebody who spews the stuff like what we saw [from Trump] at Madison Square Garden recently. I take the injunction to welcome the stranger and to feed and clothe very seriously.So under those circumstances, I've got nobody I can vote for.This retired Texas resident voted for Biden in the last presidential election and has voted early in support of Harris.I get so scared. We actually can't go back. It's very frightening to me. I had more rights than my granddaughter is going to have in her future and that's not right.It is so disturbing that it is so close. [Trump] is a felon out on bail. I don't understand the Republicans. They used to be the law and order [party], supposedly, and it's now this.I think a lot [of women] are coming out and saying, 'Why are you telling us what to do with our bodies?' Abortion is a personal thing and it's up to the doctor and the woman. It is none of my business.In the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Americans around the country about what matters to them.Are you an American voter? Want to join in?

CONTENT: Since endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views.BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers.Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about "illegal aliens" voting in this election.He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been "importing" immigrants who will vote for them in future elections.But voting and immigration experts we have spoken to have challenged this, pointing out that it is illegal for them to vote in federal elections and that even if some might qualify for citizenship eventually, the process would take many years.Mr Musk has engaged with posts on X which suggest that illegal immigrants are already voting in this election.On 30 October, he responded to a claim that illegal voters were able to apply for mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.Mr Musk replied to the claim, which has been rejected by local election officials, saying: "Is this real?"It is against the law for non-citizens to vote in US federal elections - punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation.A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of non-citizens having voted in US federal elections are very small.Since July, Mr Musk has posted at least 22 times about voters being "imported" from abroad.The language in many of these posts is ambiguous as to whether he means this will impact this election or future ones.In seven posts, he has said they are going directly into swing states.On 20 October, in a post viewed 21 million times, he said: “Triple digit increases of illegals in swing states over the past 4 years. Voter importation at an unprecedented scale!”Along with the post, he shared a table that showed very large percentage increases in "unauthorized migrants" in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, since 2021.The table, which does not have a source, had been posted by "America" - a political action committee Mr Musk set up to support Trump.We could not find evidence for these figures but migration experts pointed us towards the latest Department of Homeland Security report which has estimates for each state between 2018 to 2022.These show that in several states - including Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina - the number of "unauthorised immigrants" has remained steady or dropped over this period.They do show large numbers living in these states under the Biden administration but also when Trump was president.Mr Musk has repeatedly suggested that illegal immigrants will gain citizenship and sway future elections for the Democrats.In a post on 25 October, which got almost 17 million views, he said: “Their stated plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem. America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.”Voting and immigration experts described this as a far-fetched claim.Democrats have expressed a desire for some undocumented migrants in the US to have "an earned pathway" to citizenship, but it is not their stated policy to grant them all this."Some undocumented migrants who arrive in the US could have a route to citizenship - but that would typically take a decade or longer, if they even have a path at all, which many of them will not," says Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute.In several posts, Mr Musk mentions a 1986 bill which granted amnesty to approximately three million undocumented immigrants in the US.This was passed by Congress and signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan. It forgave individuals who came into the US illegally but did not give them immediate citizenship.“Perhaps Musk imagines that a president or administration can simply decree mass naturalisation of noncitizens without going through the prescribed individual legal processes, and that Congress and the courts would simply then accept this. That's not how it works", Walter Olson, a voting rights expert from the conservative think tank, the Cato Institute told us.On 25 October, Mr Musk posted on X: “Massive numbers flown directly to swing states and put on the fast track to citizenship. Voter importation.”The post, viewed almost 19 million times, included a chart entitled “inadmissible aliens” shared by Mario Nawfal.Mr Nawfal has been community noted (the process on X which crowdsources fact-checking from users) several times for making unverified claims.He is one of the people Mr Musk has interacted with most on X over the last few months, according to Node XL.It is unclear where the figure of 823,000 “inadmissible aliens” comes from.The chart refers to @fentasyl - the anonymous X account of a "data expert" - but does not have a source.It shows a large increase in migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti entering the US from 2023 onwards.This appears to be a reference to the Humanitarian Parole Scheme launched in January 2023. This scheme allows vetted migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to live and work in the US legally - if they have a US sponsor.Big numbers have arrived under this scheme - 531,000 people up until the end of September 2024.But they are not allowed to vote and are not put on “a fast track to citizenship”.They are permitted to stay in the US for a maximum of two years.Some may be able to apply for protected status which would allow their temporary stay to be extended. But, even if they got this, they would not be able to vote in a federal election.Those who do not qualify have to leave the country or face deportation proceedings.“There is no direct path to a green card for people entering the US from Nicaragua, Venezuelan or Haiti on the Humanitarian Parole Scheme,” says Ms Mittelstadt.“They could apply for asylum but these claims can take years, and if granted it doesn’t give you the right to vote,” she adds.To become a US citizen - and get the right to vote in a federal election - you have to go through naturalisation.To apply, someone has to have been a lawful permanent resident for five years; married to a US citizen and a lawful permanent resident for three years; or be a member of the military.As of August 2024, 3.3 million immigrants had become naturalised citizens under the Biden administration.Under Trump, the figure was around three million people.It is also worth noting that new citizens are not guaranteed Democratic voters.According to a recent survey, 54 percent of naturalised citizens said they would vote for Harris in November, while 38 percent said they would vote for Trump.We have asked X for comment and to provide further evidence for Mr Musk’s claims.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: The night before Kamala Harris sets off on a final multi-day swing through the key battleground states that will decide the 2024 presidential election, she gave one last speech, practically in the shadow of the White House.The venue choice was no accident. Donald Trump held his rally on 6 January 2021 in the same place, speaking to supporters just hours before thousands of them stormed the Capitol and disrupted certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.On a mild October night, Harris stood before what her campaign estimated was 70,000 cheering supporters at an event they may hope is a counterpoint to that cold, violent January day.And in the unlikely chance the symbolism was missed by anyone watching, Harris made it explicit early in her speech.“We know who Donald Trump is,” she said on Tuesday. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”Harris didn’t dwell on the 6 January riot, however. The venue did most of the heavy lifting, providing the subtext to the speech and the point from which Harris could pivot.While she opened by darkly warning of an “unstable” and “unhinged” Trump “obsessed with revenge”, she turned to focus on what she called her “different path”.Acknowledging that many undecided American voters “are still getting to know” her after her abbreviated presidential campaign, Harris touched on the highlights of her biography and upbringing.She went on to hit some of her top policy proposals, including lowering the cost of housing, expanding the child tax credit and adding homecare coverage to government-provided health insurance for the elderly.She spent even more time talking about abortion and the need to enact legislation that provides national abortion rights – a particularly strong area for Democrats over Republican opponents.It was, in effect, a trimmed-down version of her Democratic National Convention address – a bookend to the late August speech that the campaign billed as an introduction to Americans.Democrats were riding high back then, enthusiastic about their new nominee after weeks of despondency and infighting that led to Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid.Since then, Harris’s campaign has had ups and downs, and is now locked in what is shaping up to be a photo finish next week.If the polls are accurate, Harris still has work to be done to win over undecided Americans – and this speech was her last, biggest effort to do so on a prominent stage, with the White House looming over her shoulder.Setting aside her biographical highlights and policy details, the message her campaign seems to want voters to have in mind on election day is one of contrasts – of division versus unity; bitterness versus hope; partisanship versus co-operation; past versus future.“I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better,” Harris said. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”As she was delivering her speech, however, the current resident of the building behind her made comments that illustrated how difficult her task might be.Biden, speaking of a derisive joke about Puerto Rico that a comedian made at a Trump rally on Sunday, appeared to refer to Trump supporters as “garbage”.The president later claimed he was referring only to the comments made by the rally speaker. But the video of his remarks are unclear – and the episode was already distracting from Harris’ event on Tuesday evening.It’s just one more obstacle Harris will have to overcome, along with assuaging Americans' concerns about the economy and immigration - where polls indicate Trump has the advantage.She tried to address those in her speech as well, even if they seemed to take a back seat to more lofty language and pointed attacks.Her speech framed the election in a way that is to her advantage. Next Tuesday will reveal whether a majority of the American public – or at least a plurality in enough key battleground states - agrees.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Luke GarrettRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27 in New York City.An election betting advertisement flashed on screen during coverage of former President Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden this weekend on the Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media company."Bet on the US election," the ad for Kalshi said as Trump spoke on stage. "Bet $100 on Trump, Get $175."More than $100 million has been legally wagered on the presidential race on the platform, days out from Election Day. This explosion in legal betting comes after a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed KalshiEX LLC, an online-betting company, to open an election prediction market.The company's CEO, Tarek Mansour, told NPR his election market — which shows a 63% chance of Trump winning as of Tuesday — is a "mechanism for truth" and help regular people hedge against unpredictable political risk. But critics like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have called the legal decision a "huge mistake" that harms American democracy.Kalshi is still battling federal regulators in court. But retail investing platform Robinhood also started offering bets on election contracts this week. That leaves Americans free to make tens of millions of legal election bets, with little known about how they will impact one of the closest and most contentious presidential elections in decades.Wagering on the U.S. presidential election is nothing new. Bets on presidential candidates were common during the turn of the 20th century. Betting commissioners in New York City controlled these markets at a place called the New York Curb Exchange.Not only did bets occur, the markets were fairly accurate during a time before scientific political polls, according to NPR's former gambling correspondent and current editor Keith Romer."Of the 15 presidential elections between 1884 and 1940, the betting market correctly calls the race in 11," Romer told NPR's Planet Money. "It's too close to call in three. And they only get one wrong."Major papers, like The New York Times, would publish the betting odds as a source of information, Romer said. But in the latter half of the 20th century, during the advent of scientific polling and a number of prohibitive gambling laws, election betting fell out of favor.In recent years, prediction markets have brought election betting back. On the social media platform X, the Trump campaign, tech billionaire Elon Musk and pollster Nate Silver often post the latest presidential betting odds on Polymarket, an offshore prediction market U.S. citizens can only use illegally.To date, $2.5 billion has been bet on the presidential election on Polymarket, which also gives the former president a 66% chance of election victory. Suspicious activity has raised questions about the site's accuracy: Blockchain researchers cited by Fortune say there's evidence some one-third of the volume on Polymarket's presidential betting market is artificial.Kalshi for the first time gives Americans a legal platform for their wagers, which CEO and co-founder Mansour argued offers voters accurate information, in contrast to political polling.Rajiv Sethi, a professor of economics at Barnard College who has been studying these markets for years, said the "jury is still out" on whether prediction markets are better than traditional political polling — but it's close."They generate outputs that are actually quite competitive with the best models," Sethi said.Mansour, the CEO, said the goal is to broaden election betting to the general public, similar to the creative financial vehicles that are available to hedge risks for "high-net-worth individuals" at investment banks like Goldman Sachs, his former employer.He gave the example of an environmental company protecting itself against the election of a candidate who proposes slashing climate change initiatives."People can now do something about it," Mansour said. "They can reduce their exposure and volatility towards events that they don't really have control over."When asked about nefarious betting meant to falsely inflate the odds of a given candidate, Mansour said election markets are "self-correcting" because bettors will see an opportunity to make money on an inflated outcome."The only outcome is basically — the people who tried to manipulate in the first place lost a lot of money," Mansour said during an interview conducted when the Kalshi odds mirrored those of public polls.Mansour admitted election betting isn't a zero-risk proposition, but said Kalshi is federally regulated — meaning regulators would be able to intervene if someone tried to manipulate a market."Everything is super transparent and everyone can see anything you do and know your name and your address and what you're doing and the government is monitoring," Mansour said. "It feels like a pretty bad place to try to do any of these things."Sethi, the Barnard professor, largely agreed, citing a 2012 case when an anonymous person bet $7 million to increase the odds of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney winning the election, and failed when other gamblers caught on. But Sethi said there still is a potential for manipulation."Your belief about whether a candidate is viable, is doing well, is likely to prevail, can affect things like fundraising, support, the enthusiasm, volunteer effort and so on," Sethi said. "These things can actually affect the actual outcome of the election."Supporters of Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Harris wait on The Ellipse just south of the White House for her speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. More than $100 million have been legally wagered on the presidential race on the first legal election betting platform in the U.S. in years.One week from Election Day, the Kalshi market favors Trump by over 30 percentage points — while most political polls show Harris and Trump statistically tied. This misalignment has raised questions about the accuracy of these markets.Merkley, the Oregon senator, has opposed Kalshi from the start and proposed a bill in Congress to ban all election betting."Allowing election betting is a huge mistake," Merkley told NPR. "It turns elections from a place where you exercise your principles to where you exercise your pocketbook. It corrupts our American elections."Beyond the moral challenge, Merkley said the law prohibits it. He says it's against Regulation 40.11 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which prohibits trades on "terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law." The CFTC is fighting Kalshi in court."Gaming is betting on the outcome of a contest," Merkley said. "An election is a contest. These are not commodities. This is not oil. This is not silver."Kalshi's Mansour said he knows election betting comes with a stigma of corruption, but argued the critique doesn't hold water."We fought for these markets not because we think they threaten election integrity," Mansour said. "On the contrary, we think they promote it."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: Donald Trump is a keen golfer and owner of many coursesSporting personalities featured prominently in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump's re-election as the president of the United States, with golfer Bryson DeChambeau and UFC president Dana White making appearances on stage during his victory speech in Florida on Wednesday.It was a reminder of the new president's sporting connections before a second term during which his country will host the football World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028 - with Trump set to be a highly visible presence at both.So, what impact could some of his policies have on the sporting landscape?Trump has promised the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, and to complete the building of a wall along the country's southern border that was started during his first presidency.Such policies are set to heighten diplomatic tensions with Mexico, a fellow co-host of the 2026 World Cup (alongside Canada) and could lead to concerns among fans about travelling between the two countries.During his first term in office, there were fears Trump's immigration policies, including a travel ban for certain countries, could cost the US the right to host the tournament for the second time.Trump recently vowed to reinstate the travel ban that barred people from predominantly Muslim countries. However, he had previously reassured Fifa that fans of qualified teams would be allowed entry into the US, and the governing body's president Gianni Infantino - who is known to be close to Trump - seemed pleased by his return to the White House.The US is of crucial importance to Infantino, as it is also hosting the first edition of his controversial, newly-expanded 32-team Club World Cup in 2025. Intended to generate significant funds, it has struggled to attract commercial and media interest, and has led to legal action from the global players' union.The US will celebrate its 250th birthday during the 2026 World Cup, commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and handing the president even more global spotlight.It will soon become clear whether some of his more divisive and inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants makes some businesses think twice about sponsoring the event for fear of being associated with the president.Infantino (pictured left, with Trump in 2018) congratulated him this week, saying: "We will have a great Fifa World Cup and a great Fifa Club World Cup in the United States of America! Soccer unites the world"How would Trump’s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?Seven things Trump says he will do as presidentTrump has vowed to ban all transgender women from female competition in sports, and has regularly focused on the issue during his election campaign, including in TV adverts that criticised transgender athletes and which were shown during sports broadcasts.He has previously condemned trans-inclusive teams, arguing it threatens women's sports.Trump's rhetoric could please those concerned about the impact of transgender inclusion on fairness and safety in female competition. But with the 2028 Games set to take place in Los Angeles, others fear it could also put him at loggerheads with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has allowed individual sports to choose their own gender eligibility policies.Trump has also mocked Olympic women's boxing champion Imane Khelif, who won gold at Paris 2024 a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests.In Republican party campaign videos in the days before the US election, Trump questioned the fighter's biological sex, using it as an example of how he claimed "speaking the truth" had become "hate speech" under Joe Biden's government.Algerian Khelif and her Olympic association have always said she was born a woman and is a woman.The IOC has condemned the "abuse" Khelif has received, blaming "prejudices and culture wars", saying the fighter is eligible to fight in women's boxing.It will also be interesting to see if plans for the Olympics are affected if there is a repeat of the friction seen in the past between Trump and some Democrat politicians who hold powerful positions in California.There could also be tension with the Paralympic community before LA 2028, with Trump having previously denied accusations he mocked a disabled reporter with a congenital joint condition at a rally in 2015. Three years later he was also rebuked by the International Paralympic Committee for saying the Pyeongchang Paralympics was "hard to watch".IOC says Khelif preparing legal action after new eligibility claimsWhat does science tell us about boxing’s gender row?One of the main themes of the sporting landscape over the past decade has been allegations of 'sportswashing' amid unprecedented investment, hosting and sponsorship by Middle Eastern states.Countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly denied accusations they are using sport to distract from their authoritarian regimes' human rights violations, and have accused Western critics of hypocrisy.Could that argument gain traction after the return to the White House of Trump - a convicted felon described by his rivals as a "fascist" and a threat to democracy?Sports bodies may now face uncomfortable questions about taking their flagship events to a country where the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in 2022 by the Supreme Court, which had a majority of conservative judges following Trump's first presidency.There have also been more than 600 mass shootings in the US for each of the past four years, with Trump supportive of gun rights.During the president's first administration, Amnesty International documented "extensive damage to human rights", adding that protecting them in the US "means ending gun violence and guaranteeing adequate healthcare for all, including abortion".The human rights group has also highlighted that the US had the fifth highest number of executions (24) in the world last year. Saudi Arabia was third highest with 172 executions.Fifa says it is "fully committed" to upholding human rights when staging tournaments. But amid scrutiny of the implications of both Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup and Saudi's unopposed bid to stage the 2034 event, Trump's victory could mean the 2026 tournament now comes under renewed focus too.Two-time US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau (right) was on stage for Donald Trump's victory speechWith the US PGA tour involved in protracted negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) over a potential merger aimed at healing a split in men's professional golf over the breakaway LIV circuit, Rory McIlroy believes Trump could help bring an end to the deadlock.A proposed deal is likely to face opposition from the Department of Justice, which has concerns over a possible breach of anti-competition laws, but Trump has suggested he could end golf's "civil war", which has resulted in many leading stars being banned from the PGA Tour.Trump has praised the lucrative LIV tour, and five of its tournaments have been been held at his courses since its inception in June 2022.He has close ties with Saudi Arabia, and has also played golf with PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who could become tour chairman if the reported £1bn 'peace deal' is approved.Under Trump, Saudi influence over golf looks set to grow.The other sport to feature during Trump's victory speech was UFC, with its president White invited to make his own address on the stage.Having Trump as an ally could benefit the UFC as it continues to face legal challenges to the way it operates. This year TKO Group, which owns the UFC, agreed a £281m settlement with former fighters who claimed the MMA promotion suppressed athletes' abilities to negotiate other promotional options.Vladimir Putin (right) called Donald Trump a "courageous man" when congratulating him on his election victoryTrump has been accused by his opponents of cosying up to President Vladimir Putin. With Russia currently in sporting exile because of its invasion of Ukraine, some are asking whether he could put pressure on bodies such as the IOC to end their ban and readmit Russian competitors.Trump has also vowed to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and if that could be achieved it could lead to Russia's return to the international sporting fold.Trump has also proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said.Such trade barriers and any potential retaliatory tariffs could be unhelpful to sports leagues such as the NBA, which is trying to grow its business globally and is keen on staging games in China again, among other countries.Trump’s protectionist trade policy could be awkward for Fifa, which recently secured Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Hisense as the first official partner for next year's Club World Cup.Could tariffs on imports also make it harder for the IOC to find sponsors for the Olympics?In Trump's first term, sport and politics regularly clashed in the US, with his presidency appearing to spark a new era of intensifying athlete activism.In 2017 he was highly critical of the NFL and players who kneeled during the traditional pre-match national anthem in a protest against racial injustice and police brutality towards African-Americans, a movement started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Trump accused them of a lack of patriotism and clashed with a number of top US sports stars - including NBA legends LeBron James and Stephen Curry, and footballer Megan Rapinoe - with some teams rejecting invitations to the White House in protest at his policies.Basketball coach Steve Kerr emerged as a prominent voice of protest against Trump's suspension of the US refugee programme.In 2020, several top stars - including James - launched a campaign designed to encourage more people from black communities to have their say in the presidential election, which Trump narrowly lost.The 2024 election campaign saw both presidential candidates receive the support of a host of sporting figures. It would be little surprise if US sport is politicised once again, and if more athletes use their platforms to speak out on a host of social issues, now Trump is back in the White House.However, it is also worth noting 95% of the tens of millions of dollars donated by sports team owners in the major US professional leagues in recent years reportedly went to Republican campaigns, candidates and committees
, external
.That suggests those in charge of domestic sport are largely content with Trump, and that it may be the major international sporting events the US is due to stage over the coming years where the biggest impact of his return could be felt.

CONTENT: Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, having promised action on issues including immigration, the economy and the war in Ukraine.He looks likely to enjoy plenty of support for his political agenda in Congress after his Republican Party regained control of the Senate.In his victory speech, Trump vowed he would "govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept. We're going to keep our promises".But in some cases, he has given little detail of how he might achieve his aims.Asked in 2023 by Fox News whether he would abuse his power or target political opponents, he replied he would not, "except for day one"."No, no, no, other than day one. We're closing the border, and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I'm not a dictator."While campaigning, Trump promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history.He also pledged to complete the building of a wall at the border with Mexico that was started during his first presidency.The number of crossings at the US southern border hit record levels at the end of last year during the Biden-Harris administration, before falling in 2024.Experts have told the BBC that deportations on the scale promised by Trump would face huge legal and logistical challenges - and could slow economic growth.Exit poll data has suggested the economy was a key issue for voters. Trump has promised to "end inflation" - which rose to high levels under President Joe Biden before falling again. But a president's power to directly influence prices is limited.He has also promised sweeping tax cuts, extending his overhaul from 2017. He has proposed making tips tax-free, abolishing tax on social security payments and shaving corporation tax.He has proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said. Some economists have warned that such moves could push up prices for ordinary people.During his first presidency, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections and made America the first nation to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.This time, he has again vowed to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden's targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars.He has pledged to increase production of US fossil fuels - vowing to "drill, drill, drill" on day one in favour of renewable energy sources such as wind power.He wants to open areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs - though analysts are sceptical.Trump has criticised the tens of billions of dollars spent by the US on supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia - and has pledged to end the conflict "within 24 hours" through a negotiated deal.He has not said what he thinks either side should give up. Democrats say the move would embolden President Vladimir Putin.Trump wants the US to disentangle itself from foreign conflicts generally. Regarding the war in Gaza - Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, but has urged the American ally to end its operation.He has also pledged to end the related violence in Lebanon, but gave no detail on how.Against the wishes of some of his supporters, Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris that he would not sign into law a national abortion ban.In 2022, the nationwide constitutional right to abortion was overturned by the Supreme Court, which had a majority of conservative judges following Trump's first presidency.Reproductive rights became a key campaigning topic for Harris, and several states approved measures to protect or expand abortion rights on polling day.Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion, but struggled to find a consistent message of his own.Trump has said he will "free" some of those convicted of offences during the riot in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, when his supporters stormed the Capitol building in an effort to thwart the 2020 election victory of Joe Biden.Several deaths were blamed on the violence, which Trump was accused of inciting.He has worked to downplay the riot's significance and recast the hundreds of supporters who were convicted as political prisoners.He continues to say many of them are "wrongfully imprisoned", though has acknowledged that "a couple of them, probably they got out of control".Trump has vowed to sack "within two seconds" of taking office the veteran prosecutor leading two criminal investigations against him.Special Counsel Jack Smith has indicted Trump over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and over his alleged mishandling of classified documents.Trump denies any wrongdoing, and managed to prevent either case coming to trial before the election. He says Mr Smith has subjected him to a "political witch hunt".Trump will return to the White House as the first ever president with a criminal conviction, having been found guilty in New York of falsifying business records.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: World leaders taking part in the latest annual UN climate meeting in Azerbaijan are hoping to agree action to help rein in rising global temperatures.A key issue under discussion is how to get more cash to poorer countries, to help them curb their planet-warming gases, and to cope with the growing impacts of climate change.The decision to hold the meeting in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, has been criticised because of the country’s ties to gas and oil.The US election victory of Donald Trump - a known climate sceptic - could also prove to be a distraction, and some important leaders are not attending.COP29 is the world's most important meeting on climate change.It is led by the UN, and the 2024 event, the 29th such gathering, runs from 11-22 November.It is being held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a central Asian country located between Russia and Iran.COP stands for “Conference of the Parties”."Parties" refers to the countries that have ratified a treaty called the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).That document was signed back in 1992, by almost 200 countries.The COP is the decision-making body linked to that agreement, and representatives of these countries meet every year to negotiate the best approaches to tackling the root causes of climate change.Between 40,000 and 50,000 delegates are expected to attend COP29. This includes representatives from all UN member states, and the EU. Diplomats, climate scientists, trade union leaders and environmental activists will also take part.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the conference that he wants the UK to have more "ambitious" climate goals.Other attendees include UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.However the leaders of some of the largest economies - and biggest carbon emitters - are notably absent from COP29.US President Joe Biden, China's Xi Jinping and France's Emmanuel Macron are not attending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Schulz and India’s Narendra Modi will also not be there.They are staying away for a range of reasons, but their absence could undermine the event's significance.Leaders who do attend will also have lots of other issues on their minds, including two expensive and difficult wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine, and global financial problems."No world leader is arriving with climate change at the number one spot in their inbox," says Oxford University's Prof Thomas Hale.There’s also an underlying feeling that Azerbaijan doesn’t have the diplomatic or financial clout to secure a significant agreement.Many leaders think progress is more likely at COP30, which will be held in Brazil in November 2025.During COP29 key experts, including former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said the COP process is "no longer fit for purpose".They said: "Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity."A key question this year is money.Under the Paris agreement signed in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C. For that to happen countries need to ramp up their efforts to cut warming gases.As part of the agreement, countries committed to develop a new cash target for developing nations by 2025. This money would be used to help emerging economies cut their carbon and adapt to the worst impacts of rising temperatures.Getting agreement on a new finance target is seen as a critical step in building trust between rich and poor nations as, so far, the track record hasn’t been great.African countries and small island states want to see climate finance in total reach over a $1tn a year by 2030.Up to now countries like China and the Gulf States have been classified as developing economies and been exempt from contributing.According to the EU and other wealthy countries, that must change if the overall amount of cash is to be increased.Governments’ plans for tackling climate change in their own countries could also be a tricky issue. They must update their action plans every five years, with the next deadline falling in February 2025.Some countries will release their strategies at this COP, but if they’re weak and look unlikely to stop global warming rising beyond 1.5C, it could cause problems with countries on the front lines of climate change.It is also not clear whether the fossil fuel agreements passed at the last climate talks are still in place. There were signs at the G20 talks earlier in 2024 that some countries wanted to roll back on promises to move away from burning oil, coal and gas.Major UN talks on protecting nature also collapsed in Colombia in October, after nations failed to agree key goals.Azerbaijan has big plans to expand gas production, by up to a third, over the next decade. Some observers worry that a country with that goal is in charge of a conference that aims to transition away from fossil fuels.These fuels are one of the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.There are also concerns, reported by the BBC, that Azerbaijani officials are using the climate conference to boost investment in the country’s national oil and gas company.Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told the conference that oil and gas are “a gift of god”, and that countries should not be blamed for having them, or selling them on the international market.Shortly afterwards, Mr Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was "absurd".There are also deep reservations about holding the meeting in a country with a poor human rights record, where political opposition isn’t tolerated.The US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a "scam", and his victory has been seen by climate experts as a major setback.He won’t actually be at COP29, and the team representing President Biden will push for progress, but they know that anything agreed will not bind the new administration.With Trump's election the US is expected to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and from providing finance.However it’s also possible that Trump’s re-election might drive a new sense of unity among other leaders, even building a coalition who might agree a major step on money for poorer countries.Experts argue that the climate crisis - and the world's collective response to it - will outlast a second Trump term.The warning alarms from the climate could not be stronger.It is now "virtually certain" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.The impacts of warmer oceans have been seen with very powerful hurricanes Helene and Milton slamming into the US in the summer.The devastating flooding that killed at least 200 people in Spain in October was also fuelled by higher sea temperatures in the Mediterranean.“Climate change is a cumulative problem. That means that with every year of delay, there is additional warming that we commit our planet to. Now is the time that we need to take action,” explains Prof Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London.In the short-term, agreements at COP can change how nations build their economies, for example by pushing the development of green power. That can affect where we get our energy from and how much we pay for it in our bills.It can also commit countries to paying large sums of money into funds for poorer countries. In the UK this currently comes from aid budgets paid for by taxpayers, although private financial institutions are expected to contribute significantly.In the long-term, the talks aim to build a safer, cleaner world for everyone and prevent the worst of climate change.Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.Outside the UK?

CONTENT: By Debbie Elliott, Juliana KimThe FBI says it's aware of the offensive and racist text messages being received by Black college and high school students, and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter.Federal authorities on Friday provided an update on the series of racist text messages that were sent to Black college and high school students in the days after the election, which included messages about being "selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation."The FBI said in a statement that members of the Hispanic and LGBTQ communities also reported receiving offensive text messages. "Some recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp," the FBI added. The messages were also reported being sent via email.The FBI did not provide further details on the possible origins of the series of the hateful messages.The agency said it was "evaluating all reported incidents and engaging with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. We are also sharing information with our law enforcement partners and community, academia, and faith leaders."St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones, whose 17-year-old son was one of the recipients of a racist texts, said, "It's sick and it's wrong."Jones added, "This awful message that children around the country have been receiving about turning them into slaves and picking them up in an unmarked brown van."Her father, the student's grandfather, Virvus Jones, posted the message on social media.He says it is no joking matter to hearken back to something as horrible as slavery."I know they may think it's funny, but I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1947 when Jim Crow was legal, so it's not funny to me." he says.Virvus Jones takes note of the timing of the texts, coming immediately after a contentious, and dark, election.He added, "What it says about this country is that there are a lot of people who would like to take us back to some form of slavery or some form of being subservient to white supremacy."The Jones family is reporting the message, which appeared to come from a local phone number, to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department."These are some twisted individuals to target children like this, and I hope that they're they are found and prosecuted," says Mayor Tishaura Jones.Civil rights groups across the country are encouraging people to report the texts to police and the FBI."This is alarming, both because there's no indication who the text is from, but because all the people who received it were young African Americans," says Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center and the SPLC Action Fund.The organization, which monitors hate groups, is trying to track down the origins of the text."We have traced the texts being sent from emails that appear to have some international connection," Huang says.She says they've determined that the list of phone numbers may have been purchased from a company. "And we are trying to determine whether the company is indeed the source of this information and to whom they sold the information to actually make those texts possible."Huang says the SPLC is sharing its findings with federal officials. The FBI says it's aware of the offensive and racist text messages and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter.The Federal Communications Commission announced it was opening an investigation into the messages.Several state attorneys general and campus police departments say they have opened investigations into the source of the disturbing robotexts.A Grand Rapids, Michigan tech firm says an attempt was made to use its bulk texting software to send racist messages. TextSpot CEO Lance Beaudry says an internal AI review flagged the language as problematic and possibly indicating human trafficking or forced labor. Upon getting that alert, the company blocked the messages from going out.Beaudry says a user named Amy Jones signed up for a TextSpot account at 3:52 p.m. on Nov. 6 and tried to send a test message. It read: "You have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Be ready at 12AM November 12 SHARP. Be prepared to be searched down once you enter the plantation. You are in Plantaion group A."Beaudry says the company has reported the incident to local authorities and submitted the information to the FBI, including the IP address in the Philadelphia area where the message originated.He says the company's flagging system typically would pick up phishing or fraud messages, but that it's rare to intercept racist material or hate speech.Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her office had traced the origin of some of the messages to a virtual private network provider in Poland but had not found the original source.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: FROMBy Sam GringlasFulton County election workers process absentee ballots on Nov. 4, in Union City, Ga.ATLANTA — Every county in Georgia has certified the results of the 2024 general election, a notable step after some Republican local election board members earlier this year declined to certify other results.Typically an uncontroversial procedural move, disputes over election certification cropped up in several states in 2020, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump amplified baseless claims of widespread fraud.The 2020 examples led to worries about what would happen following the 2024 election, with Trump again on the ballot, even as election officials and experts maintained that certification is mandatory and legal guardrails would minimize disruptions.But with Trump's win in Georgia and in every swing state across the country this year, claims about widespread election fraud have largely dissipated — as have concerns about certification.Each state has its own deadlines for certification of election results at the local and state levels. Georgia's local deadline is among the earliest.Ahead of the 2024 election, battles over certification were most pronounced in Georgia, where Republicans on the State Election Board approved rules that seemingly allowed local election board members to vote against certifying election results.A judge later invalidated the rules, declaring them "illegal, unconstitutional and void." Georgia law says local election boards must certify election results by 5 p.m. on Nov. 12.But that did not stop some local election board members from pressing the courts to rule they have discretion to vote against certifying the results.One local Republican board member, Julie Adams of Fulton County, continued to push ahead in her own lawsuit, even after a judge ruled her certification duties mandatory, not discretionary.Adams had declined to certify election results on several occasions, saying she had not been able to independently verify the integrity of the results. Following the November election that saw Trump and others win in Georgia, she voted to certify those results, though she expressed reservations. "I think it's absolutely ridiculous to have a court order saying I have to vote yes," Adams said Tuesday.Fulton County election board member Julie Adams, a Republican, is seen at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center on Nov. 5.In Metro Atlanta's most populous counties — DeKalb, Fulton, Cobb and Gwinnett — at least one local Republican board member abstained or voted against certifying results from elections earlier in the year. After the November election, all four boards certified the results unanimously.Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will next complete the state certification before presidential electors meet in December."Election integrity doesn't happen just in the 11th hour, as some fringe activists claimed to try to do this past month. It is planned years in advance," Raffensperger told reporters on Tuesday morning. "I believe every county will be in good shape and have it done."While concerns about irregularities and certification have fallen off, they have not disappeared entirely. Some local board members pressed election officials for clarity about minor discrepancies in the results before voting to certify.A handful of Republicans, like Fulton County board member Michael Heekin, are now calling on the state legislature to empower local election board members with the discretion to vote against certifying results in future elections.And some activists have signaled they will continue to raise concerns about election administration, like criticism of Georgia's voting machines and voter list maintenance. But for local voting officials who were preparing to be in the eye of the storm for weeks on end after voting finished, the relative calm has felt like a seismic shift compared to 2020."It's completely different," said Lisa Tollefson, county clerk for Rock County, Wis. "This time four years ago, I was getting nasty phone calls constantly in my office and we had police protection for a while."Her county board of canvassers met Monday to verify the general election results. At a similar meeting in 2020, there were a dozen or more observers, Tollefson said.This year: "I had one observer," she said. "That's it."Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a clerk in Kent County, Mich., said media attention on the administration of elections also died down almost immediately after Michigan was called for Trump."All eyes were on us, and the second we hit midnight almost, it was like they were going to turn into a pumpkin or something and they were gone," Lyons said. "It's not just that it's less tense, but it just seems less interesting to others."NPR's Miles Parks contributed reporting.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

CONTENT: A former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia.Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a "realistic vision for peace"."And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious," he said. "Crimea is gone."A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza "does not speak for him".Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east.The president-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine.But he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for Ukraine's future from his various advisers.Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and "not the goal of the United States"."When Zelensky says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we've got news for President Zelensky: Crimea is gone," he told the BBC World Service’s Weekend programme."And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you're on your own."The US has never deployed American soldiers to fight in Ukraine, nor has Kyiv requested American troops fight on its behalf. Ukraine has only requested American military aid to arm its own soldiers.Mr Lanza said he had tremendous respect for the Ukrainian people, whose "hearts are made of lions". But he said the US priority was "peace and to stop the killing"."What we're going to say to Ukraine is, you know what you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace. It's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. And let's start having the honest conversation," he said.In response, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn characterised Mr Lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on Ukraine when it was "Putin who wants more war"."Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on," he said."Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes."A spokesperson for Trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office - said Mr Lanza was "a contractor for the campaign", but "does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him".Trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office.An unnamed National Security Council aide who previously served under Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday: "Anyone - no matter how senior in Trump’s circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn’t know what he or she is talking about."They said that the former president "makes his own calls on national security issues" and had done so "many times in the moment".Trump spoke to Zelensky after his election win, with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part in the call.A source in Ukraine's presidential office told the BBC that the "good lengthy conversation" between Zelensky and Trump lasted "about half an hour".“It was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant.”Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe.The prime minister of Estonia told the BBC that if Ukraine backs down from the conflict, "Russia’s appetite will only grow".Kristen Michal told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: "The question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more."For Russia it’s quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that’s not the plan."Last month, Zelensky presented a "victory plan" to the Ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede Ukraine’s territories and sovereignty.During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day”, but never gave further details.A paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia.Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, the paper said, but it should negotiate based on current front lines.Earlier this week, Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and said Trump's claim that he can help end the war in Ukraine "deserves attention at least".Mr Lanza also criticised the support the Biden-Harris administration and European countries have given to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022."The reality on the ground is [that] the European nation states and President Biden did not give Ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for Ukraine to win," he said.Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives approved a $61bn (£49bn) package in military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion.The US has been the biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - between February 2022 and the end of June 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (£41.5bn), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation.Clarification: This article has been amended to reflect that Bryan Lanza stopped working as an adviser to the Trump campaign after the election.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: Donald Trump has offered a sweeping immigration pitch that he has promised to begin on the first day of his presidency, including mass deportations and a major crackdown on illegal border crossings. Arizona could find itself on the frontline of these moves, and the sharply divided state is contending with what they could mean.In the Phoenix home of the Villalobos family, members across three generations discussed Donald Trump's decisive election victory with their friends.Over Latin jazz and a dinner of empanadas, beans and rice, the group - mostly women - were close to tears.“I really had hope for humanity, and I feel like we were let down,” said Monica Villalobos, 45. “It changes the way we think about ourselves in the Latino community.”Her family made America their home after immigrating from Jalisco, Mexico. They worry that friends and relatives' families could be torn apart with deportations.Trump has promised the biggest mass deportations of migrants in US history, and has pledged to seal the border and stop the “migrant invasion". He is also promising to hire 10,000 Border Patrol agents and says he will ask Congress to give all agents a 10 % pay raise.His message is one that resonates with many voters here who consistently rank immigration and border security as top concerns. Many detail seeing the impacts of illegal migration firsthand, but voters are divided on how to handle it.Arizona was, for a time, a Republican stronghold. Trump was the first to lose here in more than 20 years when Joe Biden came out victorious in 2020. The 2024 result is still too close to call - a testament to just how split residents are.Voters on Tuesday, however, overwhelmingly approved a Republican-supported measure that gives sheriffs, police and state law enforcement the authority to enforce federal immigration laws and arrest those who cross the border illegally. It had faced opposition from Democratic and Latino groups, who argue it could result in racial profiling.There are an estimated 12 million undocumented migrants in the US, and many have lived and worked here for decades. When discussing Trump's mass deportation proposals, Ms Villalobos's niece, 19-year-old university student Alexandra de Leon, said they were "terrifying".“It’s your neighbours, it's the people you see in the grocery store, it's your teachers, it's your friend’s parents,” she said. “To know that those people are in danger and their families could be torn apart at any moment… it's heartbreaking.”One of the main storylines of election night was the extent to which Trump racked up huge support from Latino voters nationwide. He saw a mammoth 14 percentage-point bump compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls.One of these supporters is Jorge Gonzalez, Sr, who moved his family to Arizona from Mexico 20 years ago in the hope of building a more prosperous future. Now the proud owner of a body shop in Phoenix, he believes Trump’s policies will help him as a business owner.“As a person I don’t like him, but as a politician, I like how he ran the economy. Many Latinos probably think he managed the country better,” he said.“He allowed a large number of undocumented workers to come here and get work visas. I didn't see any family separations,” he added. “I saw that he integrated and allowed undocumented immigrants to live and work here in a regulated way."Across the yard, Jorge’s son, Jorge Jr, was under a car examining brake pads and checking an engine.As he swapped out wrenches, he said Trump had the right tools to be a successful president.“I don't like his attitude. His mouth gets the better of him a lot of times, but when you are in a position of power or leadership, you need to be able to be a little bit tough,” he said.When asked about the mass, militarised deportations Trump campaigned on in his home state, Jorge Jr just laughed.“That's impossible!” he said, noting the millions of undocumented immigrants in the US. “You will need a lot of resources, planes, food, detention centres, police, more ICE officers, so I don't think it will be feasible.”If the Trump administration were to move forward with mass deportations, they would likely face a host of challenges. Experts are wary that federal immigration authorities do not have proper staffing to track down migrants, or the capacity to hold them until a court date.“You learn to develop a thick skin, especially coming from where we come from,” Jorge Jr said. “We don't pay attention to a lot of the things that people say, because we know those are just words and there's a long gap between the things that we say and the things that we actually do.”Others are excited to see Trump's proposals come to fruition.Mark Lamb, the sheriff in Pinal County - a conservative area just south-east of Phoenix - said Trump winning the White House would deter migrants.“Once you start holding people accountable, securing the border, you're going to start to see a lot of these folks will go back on their own. And then we can start to go after the criminals, people that are causing problems in communities.”But how Trump’s policies will actually work on the ground is still anyone’s guess.“I don't think anybody has the resources right now,” Sheriff Lamb said. “But the people he picks are going to really have to figure out what that looks like.”Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: Donald John Trump was born on 14 June 1946 in the New York borough of Queens.The fourth of five children, he had two brothers - Fred Jr and Robert - and two sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth. Elizabeth is his only living sibling.His father Fred ran a successful construction company in the outer boroughs of New York. He first joined his business in 1968, but soon struck out on his own in the heart of Manhattan.Casinos, condominiums, golf courses and hotels followed, from Atlantic City, Chicago and Las Vegas to India, Turkey and the Philippines.Donald Trump's flamboyant style helped him stand out in New York's business world and rise to stardom in the entertainment world with the TV show, The Apprentice.Trump has married three times and has five children. He first tied the knot in 1977 with Ivana Zelníčková.Trump married his third wife Melania Knauss in 2005. When they met seven years earlier, he was 52 and she was 28.His political career started in 2015 when he announced his White House bid during a press conference at Trump Tower surrounded by his family. His motto: “Make America great again”.After a bitter campaign marked by controversy, he beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in 2017.His presidency was an uncertain time for US allies, often clashing openly with foreign leaders.

CONTENT: With just one day to go, the race for the White House is deadlocked - both at the national level and in the all-important battleground states.The polls are so close, within the margin of error, that either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris could actually be two or three points better off - enough to win comfortably.There is a compelling case to make for why each may have the edge when it comes to building a coalition of voters in the right places, and then ensuring they actually turn out.Let’s start with the history-making possibility that a defeated president might be re-elected for the first time in 130 years.The economy is the number one issue for voters, and while unemployment is low and the stock market is booming, most Americans say they are struggling with higher prices every day.Inflation hit levels not seen since the 1970s in the aftermath of the pandemic, giving Trump the chance to ask “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”In 2024, voters around the world have several times thrown out the party in power, partly due to the high, post-Covid, cost of living. US voters also seem hungry for change.Only a quarter of Americans say they are satisfied with the direction the country is going in and two-thirds have a poor economic outlook.Harris has tried to be the so-called change candidate, but as vice-president has struggled to distance herself from an unpopular Joe Biden.Despite the fallout from the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, a string of indictments and an unprecedented criminal conviction, Trump’s support has remained stable all year at 40% or above.While Democrats and “Never-Trump” conservatives say he is unfit for office, most Republicans agree when Trump says he’s the victim of a political witch-hunt.With both sides so dug in, he just needs to win over enough of the small slice of undecided voters without a fixed view of him.Beyond the state of the economy, elections are often decided by an issue with an emotional pull.Democrats will hope it’s abortion, while Trump is betting it’s immigration.After encounters at the border hit record levels under Biden, and the influx impacted states far from the border, polls suggest voters trust Trump more on the immigration - and that he’s doing much better with Latinos than in previous elections.Trump’s appeal to voters who feel forgotten and left behind has transformed US politics by turning traditional Democratic constituencies like union workers into Republicans and making the protection of American industry by tariffs almost the norm.If he drives up turnout in rural and suburban parts of swing states this can offset the loss of moderate, college-educated Republicans.Trump’s detractors say he undermines America’s alliances by cosying up to authoritarian leaders.The former president sees his unpredictability as a strength, however, and points out that no major wars started when he was in the White House.Many Americans are angry, for different reasons, with the US sending billions to Ukraine and Israel - and think America is weaker under Biden.A majority of voters, especially men who Trump has courted through podcasts like Joe Rogan's, see Trump as a stronger leader than Harris.Despite Trump’s advantages, he remains a deeply polarising figure.In 2020, he won a record number of votes for a Republican candidate, but was defeated because seven million more Americans turned out to support Biden.This time, Harris is playing up the fear factor about a Trump return. She’s called him a “fascist” and a threat to democracy, while vowing to move on from “drama and conflict”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll in July indicated that four in five Americans felt the country was spiralling out of control. Harris will be hoping voters - especially moderate Republicans and independents - see her as a candidate of stability.Democrats were facing near-certain defeat at the point Biden dropped out of the race. United in their desire to beat Trump, the party quickly rallied around Harris. With impressive speed from a standing start, she delivered a more forward-looking message that excited the base.While Republicans have tied her to Biden’s more unpopular policies, Harris has rendered some of their Biden-specific attack lines redundant.The clearest of these is age - polls consistently suggested voters had real concerns about Biden’s fitness for office. Now the race has flipped, and it is Trump who’s vying to become the oldest person to ever win the White House.This is the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.Voters concerned about protecting abortion rights overwhelmingly back Harris, and we’ve seen in past elections - notably the 2022 midterms - that the issue can drive turnout and have a real impact on the result.This time around, 10 states, including the swing state Arizona, will have ballot initiatives asking voters how abortion should be regulated. This could boost turnout in Harris’s favour.The historic nature of her bid to become the first female president may also strengthen her significant lead among women voters.The groups Harris is polling more strongly with, such as the college-educated and older people, are more likely to vote.Democrats ultimately perform better with high-turnout groups, while Trump has made gains with relatively low-turnout groups such as young men and those without college degrees.Trump, for example, holds a huge lead among those who were registered but didn’t vote in 2020, according to a New York Times/Siena poll.A key question, then, is whether they will show up this time.It’s no secret that American elections are expensive, and 2024 is on track to be the most expensive ever.But when it comes to spending power - Harris is on top. She’s raised more since becoming the candidate in July than Trump has in the entire period since January 2023, according to a recent Financial Times analysis, which also noted that her campaign has spent almost twice as much on advertising.This could play a role in a razor-tight race that will ultimately be decided by voters in swing states currently being bombarded by political ads.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: When Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020, it seemed to be the death knell of his political career.His first term in office ended in chaos and condemnation - even from members of his own party.If he wins the election on Tuesday, it will be only the second time anyone has ever returned to the White House after previously losing a presidential re-election bid.“He gets knocked down and gets up twice as focused,” said Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser for the former president since Trump launched his 2016 campaign. “I don't think anybody should be surprised about this comeback.”Such an extraordinary reversal of fortune for the 78-year-old former president would also vault him back into the White House as a man who seems politically bulletproof, with a detailed plan of action and ranks of loyalists behind him.Four years ago, Trump appeared a beaten man. His Democratic opponent, Biden, had defeated him by a comfortable electoral margin in the 2020 presidential contest.Courts had batted away his attempts to contest those results. His last-ditch rally in which he urged his supporters to march on the US Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the results culminated in the crowd launching a violent attack that sent those inside scrambling for safety. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were injured.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao were among a spate of Trump administration officials who quit in protest. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” DeVos wrote in her letter of resignation to the president.Even South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies, broke with the president.“All I can say is count me out,” he said on the floor of the Senate. “Enough is enough.”The movement away from Trump extended into the corporate world, as dozens of large companies – including American Express, Microsoft, Nike and Walgreens – announced they were suspending support for Republicans who had challenged the results of the 2020 election.On the day of Biden’s inauguration, Trump broke with 152 years of tradition by declining to attend the ceremony, instead flying back to his private club in Mar-a-Lago earlier that morning, accompanied by a handful of his closest aides and family.His mood was sullen, according to Meridith McGraw, author of Trump in Exile, an account of the former president’s time after leaving the White House.“He was angry, frustrated, unsure of how to spend his days and without a plan for his political future,” she said.The media coverage and political chatter that month reflected this uncertainty over his future. After a clear electoral defeat followed by the chaotic scenes at the Capitol, some were even more definitive, suggesting there was no way back for Trump.“And just like that, the bold, combustible and sometimes brilliant political career of Donald J. Trump comes to an end,” one opinion piece in The Hill read.The subheading of a January 2021 opinion piece in The New York Times declared: “The terrible experiment is over.” The headline was even more direct: “President Donald J. Trump: The End.”But before Trump left for Florida on inauguration day, he hinted at what was to come.“We love you,” he said in remarks to supporters on a Maryland Air Force base tarmac. “We will be back in some form.”A week later, it became clear that Trump wouldn’t have to wait long to assert his continued political influence. The party came back to him.California Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, paid the former president a visit at Mar-a-Lago, posing for a photo next to a beaming Trump.In the immediate aftermath of the 6 January attack, McCarthy had said that Trump “bears responsibility” for the mob violence and recommended that Congress formally censure him for his conduct. Now he was pledging to work with the former president to win a congressional majority in the next year’s mid-term elections.Even as the Democrat-controlled US Senate was preparing to hold Trump’s impeachment trial, McCarthy’s Palm Beach pilgrimage illustrated that one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress still viewed the former president as a king-maker.“McCarthy’s visit really opened the door for Trump,” said McGraw.“It was a permission slip to Republicans who had criticised Trump to forgive him and move on.”Trump’s Senate trial would end in acquittal, as most Republicans – including some outspoken critics like minority leader Mitch McConnell – voted against a conviction that could have led to the former president being banned from future elective office.McConnell had said that Trump’s conduct on 6 January was “a disgraceful dereliction of duty”, but he chose not to take the one step that could have conclusively ended the former president’s political career – perhaps out of fear of effectively ending his own.Republicans also worried that the former president might start a third party that would siphon off support from Republicans – concerns that Trump’s closest aides did little to dispel.“It’s clearly up to Republicans if this is something that becomes more serious,” Jason Miller, a long-time Trump communications aide, said in an interview with Fox News.The former president spent the next month mostly within the comfortable confines of his Mar-a-Lago club, venturing out only for a round of golf or a private dinner.By the end of February, as the furore around 6 January ebbed, he was ready to hold his first public event.At the Conservative Political Action Conference – the right-wing confab typically held near Washington, DC but relocated to Orlando, Florida, due to Covid restrictions – the former president demonstrated that he still commanded the loyalty of the Republican base.Addressing thousands of cheering supporters in a sprawling hotel conference centre, Trump basked in the glow of their adoration.“I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together,” he said, “is far from over.”He also hinted, coyly, that he might beat the Democrats “for a third time” in 2024.An official straw poll of conference attendees only underlined what by then was obvious. Sixty-eight percent of respondents said Trump should run again. Fifty-five percent said they would vote for him in a contested primary – more then double the second-place candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis."Trump and his team were pretty nervous about that speech,” McGraw said. “Psychologically it was a really important moment for Trump and his allies when he got such a positive reception.”After a brief hiatus, Trump reactivated his steady stream of fundraising emails to supporters and resumed holding his carnival-like outdoor rallies.“Do you miss me?” Trump asked at a June gathering in Ohio. The crowd responded with cheers.“They miss me,” he concluded.If 2021 hinted at Trump’s continuing influence within the Republican Party, the 2022 midterm elections confirmed it.By then, American military forces had haphazardly withdrawn from Afghanistan, leading to the fall of that nation’s US-backed government. Gas prices and inflation were approaching highs not seen in decades. US economic growth, which had been bouncing back from pandemic disruptions, sputtered.Biden’s approval ratings tumbled into negative territory. The political environment that had seemed so hostile to Trump at the beginning of 2021 was starting to shift.“Joe Biden failed to address the primary concerns of the voters,” said Lanza. “That gave Donald Trump an opening.”Mar-a-Lago became an obligatory stopping point for any conservative candidate seeking to become their party’s nominee. The former president’s endorsement was the most coveted prize – a key to unlocking fundraising dollars and grassroots conservative support.Four of the six Republican House members who voted for Trump’s second impeachment and were running for re-election were defeated by Trump-backed candidates in party primaries. Meanwhile, Senate candidates like JD Vance in Ohio and Herschel Walker in Georgia pulled ahead in crowded primary fields with the help of Trump’s support.”His endorsement all but guarantees you a primary win,” said Brian Seitchik, who worked as Arizona state director for Trump’s campaign in 2016 and as the western regional director in 2020.But if the first half of 2022 was unambiguous good news for the former president, November’s elections painted a much different picture.Of four prominent Trump-endorsed Senate candidates, only one – author turned politician Vance – defeated his Democratic opponent. While Republicans narrowly regained control of the House of Representatives, elevating Kevin McCarthy to the speakership, the party largely underperformed and Democrats retained control of the Senate.In Florida, Governor DeSantis, the distant second-place finisher in that 2021 presidential straw poll, won a surprising double-digit re-election victory, fuelling speculation that he might be the real frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.Meanwhile, Trump fumed – blaming the Republican shortcomings on the party’s support of unpopular abortion restrictions and insufficient fealty to his own brand of conservative populism. Only a few weeks after the midterms, when pundits were still wondering if the former president’s political moment had passed, Trump formally launched his 2024 presidential campaign.The start of his presidential bid seemed shockingly ill-timed. Just a few weeks after the Republican midterm misfire, it put the former president in the headlines when many were still wondering if he had lost his political instincts.His formal announcement, held within the cozy confines of Mar-a-Lago, made his campaign feel insular and ill-suited to the current political realities.He would subsequently make news for all the wrong reasons - dining at Mar-a-Lago with Nick Fuentes, a prominent white nationalist, and posting on social media that rules in the US Constitution should be “terminated”, allowing him to be re-instated as president.“Thanksgiving through New Year’s was a pretty dark time on the Trump campaign,” McGraw said. Republicans were having their doubts.“He's announced that he's running for president, but are we sure that he's going to be able to pull this off?” she said, describing the mood at the time. “Does he have the discipline to actually do this?”Behind the scenes, however, Trump was assembling a campaign staff that – unlike 2016 and even 2020 – was headed by seasoned political operatives. Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles may not be household names, but the former was a bare-knuckled veteran of Republican politics with decades of experience and the latter had helped turn Florida into a conservative stronghold.The two worked with Trump to formulate a presidential primary strategy.While DeSantis was bogged down with official duties in Florida, Trump moved early to define the contours of the campaign, Lanza said. And while others deferred to the Florida governor, Trump hit him head-on, demeaning and diminishing him.“Everybody thought Ron DeSantis was at this powerful apex of politics that could not be torn down,” Lanza said. “Donald Trump tore the guy down.”The Trump side also received a boost from the unlikeliest of sources – prosecutors in New York, Georgia and the Justice Department in Washington, DC.Starting with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for sensitive national security documents in August 2022 and culminating in a series of indictments in 2023, the former president’s criminal jeopardy became a central issue in the rapidly unfolding Republican presidential nomination fight. Trump’s mugshot, glaring in a photograph taken at an Atlanta jail in August, was soon plastered on campaign t-shirts and yard signs.For many on the left, justice was finally being served. But among the kind of conservative voters who choose their party’s nominee in early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, it became a moment to rally around their party’s embattled leader.Conservative pollster Sarah Longwell interviewed a panel of Iowa Republicans for PBS in June 2023, a week after the Justice Department indicted Trump on charges related to mishandling sensitive government documents.“I think he’s being set up,” said one."This is election interference like we have never seen before,” said another.The indictments, according to Lanza, created a divide within the Republican Party between those who saw the indictment as an abuse of power and those who didn’t.“Initially, Ron DeSantis took the ‘didn't’ approach,” he said. “And he became roadkill.”DeSantis had at first called the March 2023 New York indictment, which he noted was about Trump’s hush-money payments to an adult film star, a “manufactured circus” that wasn’t a “real issue”.By autumn 2023, Trump had opened a massive lead in most Republican primary polls – a margin he would never relinquish. He skipped the Republican primary debates, depriving them of political oxygen. He focused instead on cementing support among rank-and-file voters through his trademark rallies and grass-roots organising.Despite raising nearly $200 million in campaign funds, DeSantis was out of the race within days of finishing a distant second in the January 2024 Iowa Caucuses. After Trump easily beat former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, the Republican primary fight was effectively over. For the third straight presidential election, the party’s nomination was his.The former president’s courtroom drama may have been a boon to his political fortunes, but it also came with very real legal jeopardy. In May 2024, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump on 34 felony counts involving hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.Every judicial setback, however, seemed to be followed by a bigger victory. His sentencing was delayed until after the election, the document indictments in Florida were discarded, and the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have sweeping immunity for official acts.Outside of court chambers, Trump’s campaign was rolling from his primary victory into the general election faceoff. A halting, confused performance by Biden in his late June debate with the former president left Democrats in a full-blown panic.Trump’s approval ratings and head-to-head polling numbers were ticking ever higher. And after his brush with an assassin’s bullet in Pennsylvania in mid-July, he arrived at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee a day later as a conquering hero to his supporters.“What we saw at the convention was how unified the Republican Party appeared, really for the first time in a long time,” said McGraw. “They were feeling incredibly confident.”Tesla chief Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, publicly endorsed the former president and began funding a massive organising operation in key battleground states. Republican pride – pride in Trump – was running high.At that moment, it seemed like Trump’s return to the pinnacles of American power from the depths of 6 January 2021 was all but complete. A campaign that had first vanquished DeSantis and his other Republican rivals was now set to deliver a knock-out punch to Biden and the Democrats.But three days after Trump formally accepted the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, Biden abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris.In a matter of a few weeks, Harris consolidated her party’s support, injected new enthusiasm into Democrats and even pulled ahead of the former president in some head-to head polls.Trump’s efforts were not helped by a scattershot debate performance against Harris in September and an apparent difficulty reorienting his campaign to take on his new opponent, whose strengths – and weaknesses – are decidedly different from Biden’s.“Trump really wasn't tested until Harris got into the race,” said Seitchik. “Everything up to that point almost felt like an extended preseason for the campaign.”With election day looming, the season is almost over and the champion is still in doubt.The race is where it seemed to be headed at the beginning of the year – a photo finish where either candidate could end up on top. And for a campaign that had focused on Biden’s age and frailty, it is now Trump whose stamina and coherence are under the microscope.“Trump can have an incredibly professional, streamlined operation around him, but at the end of the day, he's still going to do what he wants and do things the way he wants,” said McGraw.That includes a continued public insistence that he did not lose the 2020 election, extended rhetorical diversions during rally speeches and last-minute cancellations of media appearances that some have attributed to “exhaustion”.Trump has been in the whirlwind of presidential politics for nine years now – and in the public spotlight for more than four decades. He has seemed indefatigable. But with another four years in the White House looming on the horizon, are the cracks beginning to show?While Trump’s victory is far from guaranteed, simply being this close to the prize once again is itself a remarkable achievement. And if his political comeback culminates in another presidential term, he will return to the White House having overcome obstacles – legal, political, many of his own creation – that few presidents have confronted.With control of the reins of power, and without the burden of having to face the judgement of voters again, Trump will be able to make those legal dangers disappear. And unlike his first term, he will be entering the White House with a team of advisers and potential administration staff who are fully loyal to him.His intent to dramatically reorganise the federal bureaucracy could replace career civil service employees with political acolytes. And even if he doesn’t win full control of Congress, he could use existing presidential powers to impose new restrictions on immigration, enact his plans for mass deportation of undocumented residents and impose tariffs that are designed to protect US jobs but could significantly increase the cost of imported goods.Democrats warn that this would be a presidency without “guardrails” to limit what they say are Trump’s more dangerous proposals. Republicans, in a party that has been remade in Trump’s image, hope that he will be able to more effectively enact his agenda without the internal resistance he faced in his first term.“Donald Trump has converted the party from fiscal issues and social issues being the dominant force to a Trump populism,” Seitchik said. “This is all a fundamental reorientation of the Republican Party.”And if he wins next week, Trump could fundamentally reshape American government for generations to come.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: President-elect Donald Trump is joined on stage with former first lady Melania Trump and son Baron Trump during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida.In the days leading up to election night, news outlets across the country were predicting a historically close race, one that could take days to call.

But as election night progressed, it became clear former President Donald Trump was on a path to victory. So much so, that before anything was official, he thanked his supporters from his campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach.

And then, Wednesday morning at about 5:30 it became official when the Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump. We're still awaiting final tallies, but it appears Trump is on track to win the popular vote for the first time.

Trump's agenda for a second term will be dissected over and over in the days ahead. Today, we break down how America sent him back to office---how Trump won in 2024.

CONTENT: Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an “unprecedented and powerful” mandate to govern.He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.Trump’s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history.But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting.His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a "landslide" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues."It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide," said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House.That is thanks to America’s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.Here are three ways to look at his win.With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC’s US partner, CBS News.That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.In 2024, Trump’s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate "may be overwrought", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to "justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government".On a different metric, Trump’s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris’s 226.And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.Trump’s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.And it is important to remember that the “winner takes all” mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.There is another measure with which to consider Trump’s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved.Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket.Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to "2019 prices" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze."The real story is Harris’s inability to mobilise people who voted for Biden in 2020," he said.North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the presidential election in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

CONTENT: Rumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election.Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats.The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process.The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.Many posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign’s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November.When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a "fair and legal and good election".A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday.Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state.“Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network. “REPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!”The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud.While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of "half-truths" and disinformation circulating on social media.“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” he said.The BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each.The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process.One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia.The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by "Russian influence actors".Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: “Figured I would drive across the border and vote."It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border.Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.Experts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond.It's happened before.In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. "Stop the steal" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results.On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats.While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day.Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists “are preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren’t in 2020”.“We cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,” she said.These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning.“I feel very confident about Trump, as long as there’s no cheating,” said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he’d already heard rumours about fraud. “Our only hope is that it’s not big enough to change the result.”After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.Experts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters.But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating.In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud.“They WILL cheat,” says one of the thousands of comments posted.As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards.But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to “rig” the election.“Look at this new cheat voter fraud,” read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. “Dems already doing their best to steal another election.”The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say.“These incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,” said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations.Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security.On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities.They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure.“Our hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,” said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters.But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale.“If they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they’re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,” she added.The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment.A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities.Elon Musk’s America political action committee has started a community – akin to a message board – on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock.Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers – partisan observers who attend polling places.The volume of messages on these platforms – along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources – makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation.The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.The effect of this is unpredictable.The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC’s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists.And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner.Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an “ecosystem of distrust”.But despite the doubts being sown, he says, “accurate information is getting out there".“Election officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,” Mr Lozada said. “That’s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.”With reporting by BBC VerifyAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.

CONTENT: The president of COP29’s host country has told the UN climate conference that oil and gas are a "gift of God".Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev criticised "Western fake news" about the country's emissions and said nations "should not be blamed" for having fossil fuel reserves.The country plans to expand gas production by up to a third over the next decade.Shortly afterwards, UN chief António Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was "absurd".He said the "clean energy revolution" had arrived and that no government could stop it.Separately, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged further reductions on emissions, saying the UK will now aim for an 81% decrease by 2035. The UK called for other countries to match the new target."Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game," Sir Keir told the conference.Some observers had expressed concerns about the world’s largest climate conference taking place in Azerbaijan.Its minister for ecology and natural resources - a former oil executive that spent 26 years at Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar – is the conference's chairman.There are also concerns that Azerbaijani officials are using COP29 to boost investment in the country’s national oil and gas company.But addressing the conference on its second day, President Aliyev said Azerbaijan had been subject to "slander and blackmail" ahead of COP29.He said it had been as if "Western fake news media", charities and politicians were "competing in spreading disinformation... about our country".Aliyev said the country’s share in global gas emissions was "only 0.1%"."Oil, gas, wind, sun, gold, silver, copper, all... are natural resources and countries should not be blamed for having them, and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them."Oil and gas are a major cause of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.The US is also under the spotlight at the conference, following the election victory of Donald Trump - a known climate sceptic.On Monday, US President Joe Biden's envoy John Podesta called out president-elect Trump's view that climate change was a hoax and said the US team would continue to work on the deal passed at COP28 in 2023.He added that Washington was also working on a deal passed last year in Dubai to triple renewable power by 2030.Addressing the conference in Baku on Tuesday, UN Secretary General Guterres decried “doubling down on fossil fuels”."The sound you hear is the ticking clock," he said."We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and time is not on our side."He called 2024 a "masterclass in climate destruction" with disasters being "supercharged by human-made climate change".The UN's World Meteorological Organization previously said that 2024 is on track to be the world's warmest year on record.Guterres said "a new finance goal" was needed, with wealthiest countries paying the most."They are the largest emitters, with the greatest capacities and responsibilities," he said."Developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed."The Azerbaijani president's comments are unlikely to derail talks behind the scenes, which are largely about getting more cash for poorer countries to help implement their climate plans.Developing nations are calling for richer countries to agree together on a fund that could add up to $1 trillion, using public and private money.Leaders of most of the world's biggest polluters were not present in Baku, including Biden, France’s leader Emmanuel Macron and India’s Narendra Modi.The environment minister for Burkino Faso, a central African country among the poorest in the world, told the BBC that more cash was essential.Roger Baro said it would help his nation deal with the current impacts of climate change in the country, which is experiencing widespread drought, flash floods and disease outbreaks.The disasters occurred in the Sahel region, which saw temperatures of 45C this year in a heatwave that scientists said would have been impossible to reach without climate change.Among other world leaders to take to the stage on Tuesday was Spain's prime minister, who called for "drastic measures" after floods killed more than 200 people in the country.Experts say that climate change contributed to the heavy rainfall that caused the floods."We need to undergo decarbonisation, adapt our towns and infrastructure," said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.COP29 is scheduled to last until 22 November, but there are already fears that the tricky issues on the table could make a final agreement very difficult.It hoped to provide direct flights to destinations like the east coast of America and the Middle East.After being absent for more than a century, salmon have been spotted in Oregon's Klamath River Basin, following a mammoth dam removal project in California.The international centre, opening on Monday, will focus on sharing knowledge and providing training.The new deal offers $300bn (about £240) a year to developing nations by 2035.The Samoan chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States explains why some of developing nations left the talks in Baku.

CONTENT: Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has claimed that if he was prime minister he would be able to end small boat crossings “in weeks".Speaking ahead of Saturday’s result, which will see either Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch replace Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party, the MP for Newark told BBC Radio Kent he had resigned from government "because I didn’t want to be another minister who made promises about stopping the boats that I couldn’t keep".So far in 2024, 561 small boats are known to have made the journey across the Channel carrying at least 29,867 migrants.The Home Office said it would "stop at nothing" to dismantle people-smuggling gangs and bring them to justice.When questioned about how quickly he could stop the boats, Jenrick said: “If my approach from earlier this year was put into place I am confident we could stop the boats in weeks, and stop harm to people in Dover for example.”Jenrick said while he was immigration minister he spoke to people in Dover who wanted more done to tackle small boat crossings, adding: “These people were terrified and that’s why we need to leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.“We can’t have sites like Manston overflowing, we can’t have children’s services in the county struggling to help British children because of unaccompanied asylum seeker children arriving, and I want us to sort this now," he said.When asked how he would stop the boats, Jenrick said: “Anyone who arrived here would be deported either to their home country or a safe third country like Rwanda immediately.”The Rwanda scheme, which originated under the Conservatives, aimed to deter small boats crossings in the Channel by sending some people who arrived in the UK illegally to the east African country.However, the plan was stalled by legal challenges and no migrants were sent there before the general election. The scheme was then scrapped by the Labour government.However the former Conservative MP and Attorney General, Dominic Grieve told the BBC: "Only 41% of persons failing to get asylum status after coming to the UK have been removed since 2010."In the case of the vast majority this has nothing to do with the ECHR but with the inability to get their likely country of origin to take them. Claiming that leaving the ECHR will solve this is false."A Home Office spokesperson said: "We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.“The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice.”The spokesperson added that "our new Border Security Command will strengthen our global partnerships and enhance our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute" the gangs.Kemi Badenoch was approached by the BBC for an interview.Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

CONTENT: By Obed Manuel, Destinee AdamsBraddock, Pa., on Oct. 16, 2024.With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the largest battleground prize — meaning the road to victory most likely runs through here.Just days before the election, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are barnstorming the state to rally support. The state was decided by about a percentage point in 2020, and the vote expected to be close again.To see how the candidates' messages are resonating, Morning Edition hosts Michel Martin and Steve Inskeep each led teams across Pennsylvania, stopping in Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, Allentown, Philadelphia and other towns to talk with voters.The Pennsylvanians we met reflect a divided electorate. Some are voting for Harris, inspired by her vision that they say represents stability for them and because they want to see a woman as president. Others are voting for Trump because they believe in his economic policies and promises. And a few weren’t so sure about either candidate.These are some of the people we met along the way.We met Wallace at a site in New Kensington owned by Penneco Environmental Solutions, where he serves as its chief operating officer. Large tanker trucks full of recovered water used during fracking drove onto the site as we spoke. The water is treated and injected deep under the earth’s surface — a controversial practice due to concerns about water contamination.Ben Wallace, chief operating officer at Penneco Affiliated Companies, poses for a portrait an injection well in Plum, Pa., on Oct. 15, 2024.Wallace denies that the practice is unsafe and doesn’t believe in human-caused climate change. He argues that industry regulations added over decades have led to hundreds of thousands in additional costs to his business and he believes Trump would be friendlier to the industry.“This is kind of an argument I give to environmental activists all the time. Show me the industry. You know, you are in the Saudi Arabia of natural gas right now,” Wallace said. “You are standing here and you don't see the industry anywhere.”Wallace helps lead a political action committee that runs billboard ads supporting Trump and said his support of the former president goes beyond his work.He backs Trump because of what he believes are American values, which he explained as “The right of self-determination, the right to be a Christian nation, the right to determine your own outcome, the right to be free of government interference.”Faust said she’s tired of seeing so much division in the country, and she feels that the country electing a woman of color is the kind of change the U.S. needs.She began working in manufacturing to support her three daughters after a divorce. She worked the job until her body couldn’t handle it. She eventually needed surgery on both elbows. Though insurance has gotten more expensive, she still credits the union’s strong bargaining for previous health benefits. Her three daughters are all college graduates now.Rose Faust poses for a portrait in Oakmont, Pa., on Oct. 15, 2024.Ahead of the election, Faust is knocking on doors of union members, both active and retired, to encourage them to vote. She said many of the older, retired members acknowledge that the union helped obtain many benefits they enjoyed during their working days.Faust said she reminds them that President Biden signed into law the Butch Lewis Act, designed to protect their pensions, and that it only passed the U.S. Senate when Vice President Harris cast a tie-breaking vote.“They take their union and their retirement seriously,” Faust said. ‘They’ll say ‘Hey, we’re Democrat no matter what. We know how we got our jobs. We know who took care of us all these years.’”But others dismiss her sales pitch. Some members support Trump, voicing their concerns about immigrants and asylum seekers.Faust is baffled by the lack of empathy for those fleeing violence and seeking better lives. Their struggles resonate deeply with her; she was born into a troubled family and grew up in foster care.“I would open my home to anybody. Somebody opened their home to me years and years ago. Had that not happened, where would I have been? I could have been on the streets too, you know,” Faust said.He has worked for U.S. Steel for nearly three decades and is active in the local union. For him, this work represents the American dream, which is why he supports the U.S. Steel’s sale to Nippon Steel of Japan. He, like others we spoke to in this economically depressed area, believes the sale could save jobs.But neither candidate is winning him over on this issue that directly affects him because they both oppose the sale. He was truly an undecided voter, but that didn’t mean he was without his views on the election or planned to sit out like he did in 2020.William Timbers, a U.S. Steel worker and steelworkers union member, poses for a portrait in Rankin, Pa. on Oct. 16, 2024.“One candidate ain’t always going to line up with everything you believe in, so I got to go with the pros and cons,” Timbers said. “As of right now, I haven't made a choice. And everybody saying, ‘you haven't made a choice? You’re the last person in Pennsylvania’”Timbers is concerned about Trump saying the country needs to have “one really violent day,” as a way to deter theft and property crime. “Violence begets violence,” Timbers said.He added that, as a Christian man, what he loves about Trump is his pro-life stance — which was part of why he voted for him in 2016.As for Harris, Timbers described her as “independent and strong on her views and her values and. I believe she may be a good candidate.”Could he vote for a pro-choice candidate, we asked?He stopped, smiled, chuckled and took a deep breath.“That's a hard question,” Timbers said. “Yes, I could. If when you go through the checklist, if the checks is more pros than cons, I could.”Powell, who has lived here for 42 years, describes himself as a "firm believer in America" and is backing Trump.“We’re going backwards. I mean, 15 million immigrants coming in here,” Powell said. “God knows where they're at. New York City's got one square block right now where you don't dare go because they're fighting each other.”Jack Powell, a Korea War veteran, poses for a portrait at his in-home woodshop in Gettysburg, Pa., on Oct. 17, 2024.Estimates show that closer to 6 million migrants have entered the country under Biden without authorization or have been paroled into the U.S. under various programs.Powell, who gets most of his news from the local Gettysburg Times — and YouTube — has just one big concern about his candidate:“I wish he’d keep [his] mouth shut sometime, but then again, we all get our mouths in trouble.”Matthew Nell, 22, poses for a portrait outside his family home in Gettysburg, Pa., on Oct. 17, 2024.Nell, a local college student who has done voter outreach for Harris and other Democrats, lives with his parents and grandparents. His minivan displays a bumper sticker in support of Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. John Fetterman.The 22-year-old said he’s concerned about the effect of misinformation and disinformation on democracy. He worries about how false stories and conspiracy theories spread easily online and make their way around the country and the world.“We are more connected than ever and it's leading us to more division than ever,” Nell said. “There has to be a way we can change education in a way that will allow for people to have more individuality within this sea of information [and] to have informed opinions that are closer to reality.”Rivaling Trump and Harris lawn signs sit on the side of a road in Gettysburg, Pa. on Oct. 17, 2024.Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Dominguez moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, becoming a leader in Allentown’s emerging Latino community, which now makes up more than half the city’s population. He founded HALA, the Hispanic American League of Artists, to support Latino artists and preserve Latin culture.“In speaking with folks, you see this wave of change within communities of color, and the conversations have been really fascinating at the barbershops in the different places that I visit and talk to people,” Dominguez said. We met Dominguez at a roundtable discussion NPR organized with local voters.He’s fascinated by the way his community is engaging in politics at this moment.“They are listening to everything, but they're also paying attention to what they're seeing from a body language perspective and then what they can repeat and translate from Spanish to English,” Dominguez said.He said the language Trump uses is “embarrassing” and that he couldn’t repeat, or even translate, some words and ideas at the dinner table with his family.“Some Latinos that were kind of leaning towards Trump, are kind of backing away because they can't say what he's saying at the kitchen table,” Dominguez shared. “There's this embarrassing factor that's affecting our community. And so it's hard to defend him when he's offending us at the same time.”For this reason, Dominguez said Harris will win the election.After listening to others express support for Harris, Opp took a sip of water, sat up straight and said, “I'm a Republican. Yes, I'm voting for Trump.”Jeffrey Opp, a voter from the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, stands for a portrait on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024.A few ‘humphs’ and slight grunts were audible at the table, but Opp sat patiently as everyone spoke. He responded to any questions directed at him, including why he’s voting for Trump.“Track record,” he said, “We had four years of Donald Trump, you look at the economics, we were stronger in the world. Then you look at four years of Biden-Harris — high inflation, no job creation, the economy isn't as good as it was. And we're weaker in the world.”Some participants chimed in when Opp spoke, and there was a brief argument. But when the conversation ended, he shook everyone’s hands, hugged a few, and stood smiling for a picture with the whole group.We met Rivera at La Cocina Del Abuelo, a Latino-owned restaurant on a busy street where cars strolled by blasting bachata.Rivera was born in New York City, where he was involved in gang activity at a young age. In an attempt to get him away from that lifestyle, his mother moved him to Allentown. But she couldn’t keep him from it, and he got involved in gang activity in the new city and was incarcerated several times. Years later, at age 52, he’s a leader in his community.A “2024 Take America Back” flag sits on a home in Lancaster, Pa., on Oct. 18, 2024.Slim, tall and with slick-back hair, he sat and ate among several vocal Harris supporters, but didn’t hesitate to criticize her campaign.“I can say the messaging on both sides has been horrible,” Rivera said. “When someone [campaigning for Harris] calls the house and says — vote for us because you don’t want a convicted felon in the White House. [I say] hold up, I'm a convicted felon.”He said he doesn’t feel completely welcomed by either campaign.“I might not like him [Trump], but now you’re pushing me towards him,” Rivera said. “Because if he can win the White House, I can go for City Council, I can go for mayor, it opens up doors.”Although he said he has something in common with Trump, he did not say who he would vote for come November.Lopez, a local Latino radio personality, sat at the table across from Rivera. Though she nodded when others’ spoke positively about Harris, she expressed the need to make an informed decision.“I don’t want to make a mistake — or just be like, ‘Oh, she’s a female, she’s Black.’ You have to study her and you have to study every candidate.”Like Rivera, Alfa didn’t say who she would vote for, or give any indication of which candidate she’s leaning toward. But she’s confident about one thing:“My honest opinion, I don’t think the United States in general is ready to have a female. And that being said, I think Donald Trump is gonna win.”We met Hamou, 27, at Rittenhouse Square, where police sirens and car horns echoed. Streets were closed because Harris was in town.“She’s right over there,” Hamou said, smiling and looking in the direction of where the sound was loudest.Yasmine Hamou poses for a portrait at Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2024.Hamou recalled knocking on doors with her mother for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 around Gettysburg and nearby Hanover and staying up way past her bedtime to watch him declare victory.“I just remember the excitement and the energy, even in such a conservative place, [about] this historic moment,” Hamou said. “It was one of the most powerful things I’ve ever done…I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.”Now working on voter outreach for Philadelphia’s Working Families Party. Hamou is focused on engaging with Democrats and independents.As the daughter of a Black mother from the south and an Egyptian immigrant father, she’s inspired by Harris’ accomplishments as a woman of color.“I know how difficult it is when you speak up in the workplace. You have to work 10 times as hard to get half the result as your white peers,” Hamou said. “When I was voting for her, I got a little emotional because I couldn’t believe I was seeing her name.”But she’s not without reservations about the vice president. Hamou would’ve liked to hear Harris take a firmer stance against Israel’s actions in Gaza, including an arms embargo. She believes, however, that a vote for Harris is still progress and could yet lead to a more peaceful resolution than under Trump.A small band of Vice President Harris supporters march on South Broad Street in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2024.“The number one thing we need to do is block white supremacy and the far right,” Hamou said. “Anchoring myself in that, and being grounded in knowing that, is how we get progressive wins and we can build a future that we want to see.”Obed Manuel and Steve Inskeep reported from Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, and Philadelphia. Destinee Adams and Michel Martin reported from Allentown and Bethlehem.Majd Al-Waheidi edited.

CONTENT: By Kathryn Fink, Ashley Brown, Scott Detrow, Tyler BartlamAndrea Farmer (left) and Alex Cook mark off homes they have visited on their app while canvassing in a neighborhood in Nashville, North Carolina in October.Jakai Britton was not planning on casting a ballot this election season. When a group of door knockers came to his neighborhood, he wasn’t planning on having a conversation, either. But in the span of a couple minutes, he’d agreed to both.Britton, a 28-year-old non-affiliated voter in Nash County, North Carolina, was pulling out of his driveway in a black SUV, airport bound, when a canvasser from the organization Down Home North Carolina approached his car.“Can we get five minutes of your time?” door knocker Alex Cook asked. Her plea for five minutes turned into a plea for two minutes, and Britton said yes. From the passenger side window, while Britton’s car was still running, Cook made her case for why he should vote for the Democratic down-ballot candidates the organization had endorsed. She focused on the way the local races would impact health care, an issue that resonated with Britton.“So, do we have a vote from you?” Cook asked.“Yeah, you’ve got a vote from me,” Britton said.To Down Home North Carolina, the stakes of the 2024 election are too high to let a potential voter like Britton go. Nash County is near-evenly divided between white and Black residents, and in recent presidential elections, it was near-evenly divided by its results. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the rural county by two-tenths of a point. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won it by the exact razor-thin margin.Alex Cook makes her case to Jakai BrittonDown Home North Carolina is trying to reach as many potential voters as possible.In the small town of Nashville, where the group canvassed that day, it did not feel evenly divided. There were Trump signs everywhere, and plenty of MAGA flags. Still, Down Home found plenty of Democratic and non-affiliated doors to knock on.“What I noticed is that there's a lot of people who want to stay out the way,” said Adon Bermudez-Bey, Down Home’s regional field director. “They see the Trump signs, they see what's going on in the school boards, city council. They're just like, ‘I'm going to stay out of it.’ We're trying to tell them there's an organization that specifically focuses on rural areas to pull those folks out.”Bermudez-Bey said Down Home’s platform was “survival,” helping poor and working class people get basic needs met like housing and education. In an election season like this one, the organization is mostly focused on local races, but they endorse candidates up and down the ticket, usually Democrats. Most of their time is spent urging residents — especially residents of color — to get out and vote.“They don’t open the door all the time,” Cook said. “So one out of 10 doors, you might get someone.”North Carolina's state Democratic chair, Anderson Clayton, is also focused on turnout this election. The 26-year-old from rural Person County is the youngest state party chair in the country.“Joe Biden lost the state by 74,000 votes in 2020, which we know is a field margin, and that can come from all of our counties across the state,” Clayton told NPR in October.Hundreds of campaign signs line the streets of the Nash County Agricultural Center.There are potential barriers to getting those votes. North Carolina has some of the most extreme partisan-drawn maps in the nation. The state’s governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat, but Republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse.Still, Clayton has made reaching out to rural Democrats a key part of her strategy. The stakes are clear: The Tarheel State has more rural voters than any other 2024 presidential swing state.“I'm not going to win rural North Carolina this year. I'm trying to bring back margins in it,” Clayton said. “There's a difference in trying to talk to rural voters and talking to rural Democrats. I'm trying to talk to rural Democrats this year. People that showed up in 2008 that ain't showed up since because they haven't had somebody to vote for and they didn't feel like their vote actually mattered.”Back in Nashville, Down Home door knockers make their pitch to another resident. Sean Jones says he plans on voting, though in the presidential race, he hasn’t made up his mind. He said he’s leaning toward Vice President Kamala Harris.“I just recently went to go see my brother in prison this weekend, and he was kind of on my head about voting,” Jones said. “He wanted me to vote for Trump, but I still wanted to vote for Kamala. So I'm still trying to, like, look into the politics as far as what’s what and who’s who.”Down Home North Carolina canvassers pass out cards with voting information.(From left) canvassers Arquette Turnage, Andrea Farmer and Tynia Anstead check their list of potential voters.So soon before Election Day, finding a true undecided voter can feel like a rarity. But Down Home encounters them all the time, even within their own ranks. Adon Bermudez-Bey, speaking only for himself and not for the organization, told NPR he’s also undecided on the presidential race — even as he led a group of canvassers for an organization that has endorsed Harris.“I don't know if I'm voting for Kamala yet, just full transparency,” Bermudez-Bey said. “But I know that I'm definitely not voting for Trump.”Bermudez-Bey cited his concerns about Harris’ time as a prosecutor in California, and her support for Israel during the ongoing war in the Middle East. He set a deadline for himself: By the last day of early voting in North Carolina, he’ll decide between Harris or a third-party candidate.In the meantime, though, Bermudez-Bey said he still sees the merits of a Harris presidency — at least for Down Home’s goals.“No, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a lot easier for us to organize under her presidency than Trump's,” he said.The motivation of voting against Trump, rather than for Harris, was in the air a dozen miles away at an early voting site in Rocky Mount, Nash County.“I just feel like Donald Trump is for billionaires and not for working class people,” said voter Lynn Jones, who spoke to NPR after casting her ballot for Harris.Her neighbor Donnell Jones, no relation, was by her side. He had just voted for the first time in his life. Lynn said the two of them had had a series of conversations in recent weeks about going to the polls together.Early voting in North Carolina ends on November 2.“I just thought, you know, he was at an age where this just should have happened a lot sooner,” Lynn said. “But I know sometimes people are stuck in their ways, so I didn't pressure him. Just, ‘Hey, let's go vote together then.’”That resulted in one more vote for Harris.“I voted for the lady,” Donnell said.If Democrats win Nash County, and win North Carolina, it will be through thousands of interactions like what Down Home is doing — and on a more casual level, what Lynn Jones did with her neighbor Donnell. The key will be nudging others to show up and vote, regardless of how disengaged or skeptical they were at the beginning of those conversations.Early voting in North Carolina ends on November 2. So far, more than 3.6 million voters have cast their ballots.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Subscribe to NPR's Politics Newsletter and check out NPR's live blog for more election updates and analysis.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Erie, Pa., on July 29.Former President Donald Trump has been elected president again, according to a race call by the Associated Press. Trump won the key states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with a combined 29 electoral votes to clinch more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. As of 6:15 a.m. ET Wednesday, Trump had 277 electoral votes total. Several states, including Michigan, Arizona and Nevada are still outstanding.

Prior to the race call for Wisconsin, Trump spoke at Palm Beach Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he stood flanked by family and staff and spoke to a crowd of supporters. “We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.

Trump said he won the popular vote, but those results have not been tabulated.

He will return to the White House after falsely claiming the 2020 election was rigged and stoking the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. He is also the first convicted felon to win the White House.

Republicans have retaken the Senate. They could very well have in the neighborhood of 55 to 56 Senate seats when all the counting is done. The House will not be determined for some time. It could take a week or so, as there are many close races. Sixty-two seats remain uncalled at this hour. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take control of the House. It appears they may come very close. But whoever wins control will do so by a very small margin.

— by Domenico Montanaro, NPR's political editor/correspondentNow that Republicans have reclaimed a Senate majority, Trump will have the opportunity to appoint more judges and increase his influence over the courts. However, any efforts to advance legislation will depend on control of the House, which is still too close to call.The East Colonnade, previously lined with static photo collages, now features digital displays under each archway, highlighting American history and key moments in the White House and presidency, as seen on Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024.The White House has been offering the same tour for decades, with little change over the years.

CONTENT: A big event should prompt big feelings.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Americans are anxious about the election. The American Psychological Association’s annual Stress in America survey found that, as of August, politics was the leading cause of stress for seven out of 10 adults across party lines. In a poll from a mental-health-care company the same month, 79 percent of respondents reported that the presidential election made them feel anxious this year, and more than half thought about the election every day. Now that the election is imminent, one can only assume that Americans’ anxiety is even higher.Many U.S. media outlets have responded by offering their readers advice on how to calm down. Type election anxiety into Google, and you’ll find dozens of articles instructing you to focus on aspects of life outside of politics, to spend less time watching the news, or to use relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises to subdue the negative feelings.But there’s another way to think about election stress: A big event should prompt big feelings. The stakes of this election go far beyond anyone’s preferred party winning or losing. “Voters on both sides of the aisle are being given a message that if the other side wins, this will be the end of American democracy as they know it,” Andrew Civettini, a political scientist at Knox College, told me. Why wouldn’t you feel anxious?In Western philosophy and psychology, emotions have long been cast as the opposite of reason. In Stoicism, emotions are considered “non-reasoning movements,” wild inner beasts that a person has to keep in check in order to live well. During the Enlightenment, reason was widely considered a better guiding force than the senses or the emotions. This notion occasionally rears its head in cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches patients that feelings aren’t facts, so that they can act despite their anxiety or insecurity. This week, Arianna Huffington argued in Time magazine that Americans shouldn’t be stressed out by polls. “The way to best affect outcomes is to find the eye of the hurricane, and act from that place of inner strength and wisdom,” she wrote.But political emotions motivate action all the time. “When we experience anxiety about politics, it causes us to pay more attention, and that could have positive learning effects,” Civettini said. Steven Webster, a political scientist at Indiana University, has found that political anger can push people to vote and donate to campaigns. People can, Webster told me, get too emotional about politics: Too much anger, anxiety, or fear might motivate people to support political violence, or isolate themselves from any person or news source that doesn’t confirm their beliefs. But overall, he said, “it’s not obvious to me that we should want to reduce political emotions.”Although emotions, with their heat and urgency, can overtake and weaken people, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum has argued that they reflect inner judgments and evaluations—in other words, that they are reasonable and intelligent responses to real-world events. For example, to have fear, as Nussbaum wrote in her book Upheavals of Thought, “I must believe that bad events are impending; that they are not trivially, but seriously bad; and that I am not entirely in control of warding them off.” In this way, Nussbaum noted, emotions—not some mythic, unemotional source of rationality—reveal what we require to live well and flourish.Throughout history, major political shifts have been met with equally big feelings, says Kerstin Maria Pahl, a historian of political emotion at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and a co-editor of the 2022 book Feeling Political. Apathy, a longstanding Christian concept, became part of Western political language at the end of the 18th century. “Not being affected by something made you a bad person, because you didn’t take any interest in the common good of mankind, or welfare of humanity,” Pahl told me.Allowing so much emotional interest to go unchecked might sound counterintuitive in 21st-century America, where cultural forces and psychological experts teach that emotions must be regulated for optimal well-being. But election anxiety highlights what emotions are for: to reveal what we care about, and what our moral values are. Thomas Szanto, a political philosopher at the University of Flensburg, in Germany, told me that many Americans’ political emotions are fitting responses to the election cycle. “There is something at stake for people,” Szanto said. Earlier this year, Szanto and his colleague Ruth Rebecca Tietjen argued in a paper that a political emotion is appropriate if it is functional—for example, if it pushes people to vote or seek out information about candidates—and if it has a moral component that mirrors a person’s concerns about their world, and their sense of right and wrong. Anxiety is an appropriate response from a voter who believes that Donald Trump is a threat to reproductive rights, which would violate their moral belief in bodily autonomy. Similarly, a voter who believes that abortion is murder would have a fitting emotional reaction to the idea that a Kamala Harris presidency would lead to more access to abortions.In Philip K. Dick’s 1968 dystopian novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, people can conjure any emotion they want through the use of a machine called the “mood organ.” When Iran Deckard, the wife of bounty hunter Rick Deckard, programs for herself a six-hour “self-accusatory depression,” Rick asks why she would subject herself to that when she could feel anything else. She replies that it feels wrong to not respond emotionally to the ongoing calamities in their world. “That used to be considered a sign of mental illness; they called it ‘absence of appropriate affect,’” she tells Rick.Americans in 2024 don’t need a mood organ to feel any variety of negative emotion in response to this election. They are feeling anxiety, sadness, and dread, all on their own. Surviving the remaining days until November 5 requires not simply turning off those emotions, but paying attention to what they are telling us.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

CONTENT: FROMBy Rosemary WestwoodAmanda Zurawski (middle) and Kaitlyn Joshua (right) have been sharing their personal stories of being denied abortion care. While campaigning for Democrats as part of the Reproductive Freedom bus tour, they appeared on the Aug. 14 show Political Connections with host Ybeth Bruzual (left) in Orlando, FL.If the US Supreme Court had not overturned Roe v. Wade, Nancy Davis and Kaitlyn Joshua might never have met, or become public figures.But within weeks of the ban taking effect in 2022, both women were denied abortion care in their home state of Louisiana.This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News.Ever since, they have been talking about their frightening and fraught experiences, joining a new wave of women willing to publicly share their medical experiences, and wielding a new kind of political power.Dozens of women have been speaking out loud what many previously had kept private. As part of the fight for abortion rights, many of them have been campaigning across the country for politicians — especially Vice President Kamala Harris — and participating in media interviews, political rallies, protests and lawsuits.It’s an open question, but some believe their stories and the reproductive rights issue could change election outcomes — both at the federal level, and in states, including those considering ballot initiatives on abortion rights.In the summer of 2022, Nancy Davis, already a mother of two girls, was expecting her third child. In late July, when she was 10 weeks pregnant, her doctors in Baton Rouge told her the fetus was developing without a skull. It’s called acrania, and is always fatal for the fetus.But Louisiana had banned nearly all abortions on Aug. 1, and after that, Davis’s doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy.Nancy Davis (left) with her daughter Summer, and Kaitlyn Johsua during a Free & Just event for reproductive freedom in New Orleans, LA, on Oct. 14, 2024.Davis was devastated, and then she took a dramatic next step, one that has become increasingly common since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe in the Dobbs case. She went public.Davis emailed a local TV station in Baton Rouge, and started giving interviews to other local, and then national, news outlets.Davis soon hired a civil rights lawyer and held a press conference on the steps of the Louisiana capitol, calling on state lawmakers to change the law. Her goal was to save other women from hearing the message the doctors had given her: “Basically they said I had to carry my baby, to bury my baby,” Davis said.Even with all this publicity, it took Davis several weeks to gather enough money to travel to New York to end her pregnancy. Through it all, she continued to speak out, even appearing on the Dr. Phil show.“I knew if I was going through it, other people was going through it as well,” Davis told NPR.While Davis was talking to the media, another Baton Rouge woman, Kaitlyn Joshua, was beginning her own slow-motion collision with the new state law. It was early September 2022, and Joshua was 11 weeks pregnant with her second child. She was busy getting ready for her daughter’s fourth birthday, when she started miscarrying.She was in excruciating pain, and bleeding so much that her husband feared for her life.Over the course of two days, Joshua went to two different emergency rooms seeking abortion care to empty her uterus and complete the miscarriage. This would lessen the bleeding and pain.But Louisiana’s abortion ban had only been in effect for six weeks, so doctors refused to perform a D&C procedure or prescribe medications for the miscarriage. Joshua ended up miscarrying at home, with only her family’s support, in pain and frightened for her health.Joshua remembered seeing Davis telling her story in the news. She was inspired to go public as well. She spoke at a state health department hearing on Louisiana’s abortion ban, and later told her story to NPR and then to other prominent outlets.Joshua and Davis met at an abortion rights rally in 2023 and became friends.They lean on each other for support, especially when testifying against anti-abortion laws in Louisiana’s legislature capitol, which is 76% male, majority white, and comprised of a supermajority of anti-abortion Republicans.Both Davis and Joshua began traveling with President Biden’s re-election campaign, and later switched to campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris. Both women attended the 2023 State of the Union address.Joshua appeared in a television campaign ad for Biden. She was also one of several women who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, sharing traumatic stories about how the Dobbs decision had harmed their pregnancy care.“No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have,” Joshua told the convention crowd and millions of voters watching from home. “They write to me, saying, ‘What happened to you, happened to me.’”The convention also featured two Texas women who sued their state after being denied abortions — Kate Cox, denied care after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis, and Amanda Zurawski, who became septic after doctors refused to provide miscarriage care.Kaitlyn Joshua and her son, Liam, pose with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff during a rally for then-candidate President Joe Biden in Clawson, Michigan on June 24, 2024.Another speaker was Anya Cook, a Florida patient who lost half her blood volume after she was denied abortion care and began miscarrying in a bathroom.There have been many more patients with similar stories going public over the last two years. And those stories have helped shape the election in new ways.On November 5, voters in 10 states will decide whether to add abortion rights to their state constitutions.Depending on the outcomes, areas of the South and Midwest could experience dramatic reversals after two years of extremely rigid bans on abortion.Vice President Harris is counting on support for abortion rights to help lead her to victory, and has promised to sign any federal bill that Congress might pass restoring abortions.Republicans, sensing the political headwinds, have toned down aggressive anti-abortion messaging.Former President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages, boasting about appointing the three Supreme Court Justices who helped overturn Roe, while also claiming his second term would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.”Preliminary political research indicates that women like Davis and Joshua, telling their own personal stories, are reaching voters.These stories have proliferated. A study from the University of California at San Francisco of major newspaper coverage found that just one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, 20% of stories about abortion included a patient’s personal experience — up from just 4% as recently as 2018.These stories often feature women with wanted pregnancies who were denied medical care, said one of the study authors, Katie Woodruff.“Certainly the general public did not expect an abortion ban to be affecting basic maternal health,” she said.One poll found women voters rank abortion as their number two priority this election cycle, just a few points behind the economy.Over three-quarters of women want abortion legal in all or most cases, another survey found. Even in swing states, majorities of both Democrats and Republicans told pollsters they support abortion rights.Nancy Davis rests for a moment with her daughters Asia (left) and Starr (in arms) inside the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom tour bus on Sept. 23, 2024 in Michigan.Harvard professor Robert Blendon cautioned that voters often say they support certain policies, but that support hasn’t always dictated who they end up voting for.But this year, there are some signals that the new cadre of abortion storytellers could be turning surging support for abortion rights into actual votes.Tresa Undem, a pollster with PerryUndem, said her surveys show that voters who have heard stories like Davis and Joshua’s, when compared to those who haven't, are more likely to say the state of abortion rights will affect who they cast their ballot for in 2024.The shift was particularly striking among independents who favor abortion rights: 73% who heard those stories said the abortion issue will affect which candidate they vote for.But for those who hadn’t heard such stories, only 21% said the abortion issue would affect who they vote for.Undem added that despite the rising media coverage, Republicans are less likely to have heard the stories of women denied care.Advocates in Florida, one of the 10 states with an abortion rights measure on the November ballot, have made these stories central to their advertising and messaging.The campaign is featuring the stories of women such as Cook and Shanae Smith-Cunningham, two Floridians who were each denied care after their waters broke early in pregnancy. Canvassers for the “Yes on 4” campaign bring them up every time they knock on a voter’s door.“Our hope is that those stories are so impactful that they remember when they are in the ballot booth,” said Natasha Sutherland, the communications director for the "Yes on 4" campaign.Organizers who recently won abortion rights ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan told NPR that personal stories were key to getting out the vote.“That's what actually drives it home for people and makes them realize, ‘Wow, I need to get to the polls to do this, because there's somebody out there in my town, in my community, maybe in my family, that's counting on me to take this action,’” said Gabriel Mann, who worked as the communications director for Ohioans for Reproductive Rights, the group that passed Issue 1 establishing abortion rights in 2023.Nicole Wells Stallworth, one of the leaders of Michigan’s Proposal 3 in 2022, said the campaign leaned into abortion stories after internal polling showed just how effective it was.She said ads featuring women’s personal stories increased support for the proposal by an average of 5.7%. With moderate voters the shift was even greater: 6.9%.All that data underline what Davis and Joshua say they have experienced routinely after telling their stories: people change their minds.Joshua has spoken to Black conservative Christians about her story, and then heard them preach from the pulpit about the need for abortion care, she said.

CONTENT: And how to stop itProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Sign up for The Decision, a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.The biggest risk our democracy faces this election is whether the votes cast will even matter. Any number of scenarios could play out. Ballots could be (and in fact have already been) lit on fire, or the courts could intervene to throw out votes. But the possibility we should fear the most is the one we still have a chance to prevent: the United States Congress overturning the election.Donald Trump in 2020 and early 2021 tried to use Congress to do just this, but he also tried so much else that remembering the details is hard. The details, however, are important. Trump’s desperation after losing the election led him to push to disallow votes everywhere he could—browbeating state legislatures, local election boards, state courts, federal courts, and ultimately the U.S. Congress on January 6. It all failed spectacularly, but that was an amateur effort, and one that would have required near-perfect execution to succeed. Joe Biden had won 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232, meaning that Trump would have had to overturn the results in several states to become president.This time, the election results might be closer. A tight margin would allow Trump to play in all of the same fora as last time, and now with people who have spent years developing the art of the steal. Even if Trump loses every court case, every attempt to persuade a state governor or state legislature to toss out the popular vote, and every maneuver to try to pressure state and local officials, he may yet use Congress as a backup plan.Tyler Austin Harper: Of course Black men are drifting toward TrumpThis is, I suspect, the “big secret” Trump mentioned this week, with a grin, to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. It’s a secret only because Trump wants to keep it in his back pocket, but it may be quite similar to what he attempted last time. Under laws passed by Congress, including the Electoral Count Act and the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act, here’s what is supposed to happen:Congress’s 2022 Reform Act was intended to reduce opportunities for mischief, but even so, mischief may yet emerge. For example, what does “lawfully certified” mean? If Trump claims that undocumented immigrants voted in a state, does that mean the state’s vote was not “lawfully certified”? What about claims that absentee ballots were wrongly counted? Or that ballots arrived late?The answer to all of these is an unequivocal no. Lawfully certified has long had a much more precise and technical meaning about procedure—simply whether the state’s governor has certified the vote. That narrowness has led some to say that there is nothing to fear, especially because Congress has tightened the rules in the 2022 act and made it harder for Congress to second-guess election results. I very much hope that’s right. It should be right. It is right. But we are living in a world where the whole enterprise and meaning of law is contested, and where politicians stretch laws past their breaking point. James Madison warned us about this in The Federalist Papers, calling law a mere “parchment barrier.” This time, the parchment may not hold.Here’s how the nightmare scenario could play out. Imagine the election puts Kamala Harris in the lead, with 277 to Trump’s 261 votes. Further imagine that part of that lead comes from Pennsylvania. And then imagine that Pennsylvania decides to count mail-in ballots that are missing the required handwritten date on the envelope. Trump then challenges that practice, claiming that the Pennsylvania legislature has set rules that forbid counting those ballots. He goes through the Pennsylvania courts, all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which rejects his challenge and allows the ballots to be counted. Trump then goes to the U.S. Supreme Court, which also rejects his challenge.Although that should be the end of the madness, it may not be. On January 6, one-fifth of the House and one-fifth of the Senate can claim that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acted improperly by counting these ballots, in defiance of state law. They can assert that they have the right to interpret the law independently, and that Pennsylvania has acted lawlessly. The good news here is that Congress in 2022 foreclosed that independent congressional-determination route, and said that court decisions are binding on Congress when it acts on January 6. But there is room for tendentious arguments about what Congress actually legislated, and some (including Senator Ted Cruz) have already said they believe that the 2022 act is unconstitutional. So despite Congress’s very strong 2022 efforts in this regard, an unprincipled House and Senate could try to assert these powers. The assertion of such powers would be bogus, but a debate on the floor would then ensue, and if a raw majority of the House and Senate sustain the objection—no matter how specious it is—Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes would be struck, leaving 258 electoral votes for Harris and 260 for Trump. Trump would then be declared the president.Such a decision could and should be contested in court, and challenged all the way to the United States Supreme Court, where the challenge should win. Congress would be defying the parts of the 2022 law that tightly restricted the types of objections, as well as provisions in the law that make court determinations conclusive on Congress. The question is, if Congress acts lawlessly, what will the Supreme Court do about it? Some are pointing to the Court’s recent decision to permit Virginia to strike 1,600 individuals from the voting rolls as evidence of its politicization, but defenders of the Court can point to the fact that it stayed out of the mischief in 2020, with hopes that it will act responsibly again in this go-round. The situations are, however, different. The 2020 request was on the part of the mischief makers, asking for the Court to affirmatively intervene in Trump’s favor—something the Court was apparently loath to do. This time, nonintervention favors Trump. The Court can say it is acting neutrally by not hearing the case and, by doing so, effectively hand the presidency to Trump in defiance of the will of the people.Read: The Democratic theory of winning with lessThe Supreme Court, of course, is fully capable of realizing the difference between affirmatively intervening in 2020 (where it was being asked to facilitate Trump’s theft of the election) and 2024 (where it would be asked to prevent such a thing). A decision to stay out in the face of congressional lawlessness should be unthinkable. And let us hope that it is (recall the Court just last year in Moore v. Harper rejected, by a 6–3 vote, a Republican Party theory that would have given it an immense advantage in federal elections). But just in case, one important thing must be done to prevent this nightmare from unfolding: vote.If as a result of the vote on November 5, Harris claims a decisive victory in the Electoral College, then there is little to fear, much as Trump might try to fight it. And even if the Electoral College is close, remember that Americans also vote for the House and the Senate on November 5. And the new House and Senate, not the existing ones, will make all of the decisions outlined above on January 6, 2025. If the Democrats control the House, or hold the Senate, this divided government will prevent the nightmare scenario from coming to fruition. And even if the Republicans control both houses in 2025, electing people who will honor the language and purpose of the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act—which, again, was written to prevent this scenario—will put an end to the madness.So when you vote, vote for candidates who will ensure that the will of the people will govern. James Madison in “Federalist No. 55” reminds us that the “degree of depravity in mankind … requires a certain degree of … distrust,” but “there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.” Republican government, Madison went on, depends on the latter. Let us pray that those qualities lead Americans to the polls on Tuesday and, once there, that they vote to protect our democracy.More StoriesInvestigate ThemRoger Stone Can Be Tried, Again

CONTENT: Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.The 62-year-old's nomination on Friday evening kicked-off a series of cabinet announcements and White House appointments that leaves Trump's top team almost complete ahead of his return to the presidency in January."Scott is widely respected as one of the World’s foremost International Investors and Geopolitical and Economic Strategists," Trump said in his announcement on Truth Social."[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda," he said, adding that Bessent would "support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances."Bessent has made it well known that he wants to extend tax cuts made in Mr Trump's first term in office.He has also defended the use of import tariffs, one of the more controversial parts of the President-elect's campaign agenda, calling them a "useful negotiating tool".On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a "new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes".Trump also nominated Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for US Labor Secretary on Friday, saying she would help to "grow wages and improve working conditions [and] bring back our manufacturing jobs".The representative from Oregon, 56, won strong trade union support but narrowly lost her bid for re-election earlier this month, meaning her nomination will not affect the Republican majority in the House come January.He then made another cabinet nomination moments later, announcing Scott Turner as his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NFL veteran and motivational speaker previously served in the Texas House of Representatives.Trump also announced a series of senior health picks, giving his backing to Fox News contributor Dr Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General and former Florida Congressman Dr Dave Weldon as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).He selected Russell Vought as director of the US Office of Management and Budget, which helps decide policy priorities and how they should be funded.Vought, who played a role in Project 2025 - a "wish list" for a second Trump presidency by the conservative Heritage Foundation - held the same position during Trump's first term.The president-elect also announced White House roles for Alex Wong and Sebastian Gorka who also served during Trump's first term.If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term.Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.Such ideas have been met with alarm in traditional economic and corporate circles.In an interview with Fox News shortly before the election, Bessent said ensuring the tax cuts do not expire as planned at the end of next year would be his top priority, if he ended up in the administration."If it doesn’t happen, this will be the largest tax increase in US history," he warned.For other posts, Trump has been willing to back candidates with minimal experience in favour of loyalty and apparent conviction in his pledges.But he has appeared more hesitant to buck convention at the Treasury Department, which serves as a key liaison between the White House and Wall Street and has critical functions that include collecting taxes, supervising banks, wielding sanctions and handling US government debt.In his announcement, Trump said Bessent would “help curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt”. That issue has long been a priority for traditional Republicans, but financial markets see an increase in debt as a risk in a second Trump term.Bessent, a native of South Carolina, made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.In 2015, he started his own fund, Key Square Capital Management, which is known for making investments based on big-picture economic policy.He and his husband, a former New York City prosecutor, married in 2011 and have two children. He is known for philanthropy in South Carolina, where his family has deep roots.Bessent has defended tariffs - a capstone of Trump's protectionist agenda - arguing that opposition to them is rooted in political ideology and not "considered economic thought".But he has also characterised Trump’s support for such border taxes as a negotiating tool, suggesting the president-elect isn’t necessarily committed to aggressively raising duties.That stance makes him more moderate than others whose names were floated for the treasury role.However, Bessent has been a strong proponent of Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Such support would make him the first treasury secretary to openly champion cryptocurrency, sending a clear signal that Trump is serious about establishing the US as the "crypto capital of the planet".Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.Ever since two young men were jailed for killing their wealthy parents in 1989, the case has gripped the US.Ryan Kobayashi died after travelling in search of his daughter, who has been missing since early November.

CONTENT: By Tamara Keith, Barbara SpruntPresident Biden shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office on Nov. 13, 2024.Former and future President Donald Trump met with Republicans in Congress and visited his old office today, the Oval Office, making his first trip to Washington since winning the presidential election.President Biden invited his predecessor and successor for what is a ceremonial tradition meant to signal the desire for a smooth and peaceful transfer of power.In a very brief photo-op at the beginning of a meeting that lasted almost two hours, the leaders shook hands and Biden congratulated Trump and said he looked forward to a smooth transition.Trump said: "It will be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.""Politics is tough and in many cases it's not a nice world, but it is a nice world today," Trump said.The leaders had "substantive" private discussions with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and Susie Wiles, who will have the job when Trump takes office in January, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.Biden said Trump was "gracious" and "came with a detailed set of questions," Jean-Pierre said, declining to go into details about what was on that list. The leaders discussed the government funding bill that Congress needs to pass by Dec. 21, and disaster aid funding after this fall's hurricanes, Jean-Pierre said."The length of the meeting tells you that they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues," she said."This is not about President Biden or President-elect Trump. This is about the American people, and what's right for the American people," Jean-Pierre said.Biden made the case to Trump that it's in the U.S. national security interest to continue to stand with Ukraine in its war with Russia, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. Trump and many of his aides have expressed skepticism about U.S. aid to Ukraine.First lady Jill Biden was there to greet Trump on his arrival, the White House told reporters, giving him a handwritten letter for Melania Trump, who did not attend.House Speaker Mike Johnson welcomes President-elect Donald Trump at a House Republicans Conference meeting at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill on Nov. 13, 2024.Trump started his day in Washington with a visit to a hotel ballroom where House Republicans were meeting to select their new slate of leaders. Trump was met with a standing ovation and lengthy cheers as he was joined on stage by Wiles and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk who has become a close adviser.Republican House members leaving the morning conference were in high spirits, describing a celebratory atmosphere in the room where Trump thanked them for their support."He's on fire," said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. "The agenda he's putting forward is unbelievable."Trump broadly laid out his vision for top priorities for his administration — including continuing to build a wall along the southern border."It was like, 'We're going to move fast, hang together, be a team' — kind of a rah-rah address, which is about what I expected," said Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole. "It's not the place to lay out a policy agenda, and he certainly didn't do that."Instead, Trump focused on unifying a party that has been hampered by infighting and chaos for the past several years as they fought Biden and Democrats in divided government.The mood has shifted dramatically as Republicans prepare for unified control in Washington. Several important House races are still outstanding but Republicans are on track to secure a narrow majority in that chamber after winning a 53-47 majority in the Senate.President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump hold a brief photo op at the start of their meeting in the Oval Office on Nov. 13, 2024.In 2020, Trump refused to accept the results of the election and did not invite Biden to the Oval Office.But in 2016, then-President Barack Obama sat next to Trump in the Oval Office just two days after Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.In this file photo from Nov. 10, 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump listens to then-President Barack Obama speak after their Oval Office meeting.Sitting side by side, Trump called Obama a "very good man," said it was an honor to meet with him and expressed surprise that the conversation had lasted more than an hour.The one piece of advice Obama gave Trump while reporters were in the room was, "Don't answer the questions when they just start yelling it."That's something Trump immediately ignored when in office. He frequently held court as reporters shouted questions, responding to the ones he felt like answering and sometimes sparring with the journalists.But on Wednesday, both Trump and Biden ignored reporters' questions.Biden campaigned against Trump twice, winning in 2020 with an argument that Trump was an existential threat to U.S. democracy.Then during the 2024 campaign, their one meeting on a debate stage in late June essentially ended Biden's bid for a second term. During the remaining months of the campaign Trump often gloated about his knock-out punch in the debate and bemoaned the "coup" that forced Biden out of the race.But, the day after the election, Biden phoned Trump to congratulate him and invited him to the White House for a meeting."I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition," Biden told staff and members of his cabinet gathered in the Rose Garden last week. "That's what the American people deserve."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

n a letter to his wife, Olga, the playwright and political dissident Václav Havel wrote, “Hope is a dimension of the spirit. It is not outside us, but within us.” Havel sent the note from a Prague jail, after being imprisoned for criticizing his country’s regime from 1979 until 1983.Havel could have been forgiven for rejecting hope. After the Prague Spring, a brief period of political protest and social liberalization, Czechoslovakia had veered back towards Soviet rule.  Authoritarians had tightened their grip on law, media, and culture, Havel forced to survey it all from a tiny cell. Some Americans might feel that the current moment runs parallel with Havel’s, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election to a second term as President. Many Democrats have abandoned hope in favor of cynicism: deciding that most of the voting public are selfish, bigoted enemies of democracy.This is an understandable response, but perhaps not a helpful one. Writing off vast swaths of Americans fuels trends most of the nation abhors. Research finds that people who mistrust their fellow citizens are most likely to support “strong man” leaders who promise to protect people while stripping away their freedoms. Donald Trump capitalized on this phenomenon, offering a fever dream of American carnage that beguiled many people into his camp. For instance, violent crime has been declining across the U.S. for decades, but many Americans—especially if they watch conservative media—falsely believe it’s on the rise. People who held that dark view favored Trump by more than 25 points. It’s not just crime. According to the Pew Research Center, Americans’ faith in institutions—including education, science, and government—has plummeted, but this drop is steepest among Republicans.The 2024 U.S. election reflected deep cynicism among voters about the nation and where it was headed. And if you are disheartened by the outcome, you might reasonably fear where we’re headed now.Read More: Your Cynicism Isn’t Helping AnybodyOptimism—the idea that things will turn out well—could feel ridiculous with all that’s happening. But what Havel knew, even while sitting in his cell, is that hope is different: the idea that things could improve. It acknowledges that we have no idea how the future will unfold—and in that uncertainty, our actions still matter.We have stereotyped hope as naive, privileged, even toxic: sticking our fingers in our ears and tuning out the world’s problems. It’s nothing of the sort. Centuries ago, philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas described hope as a struggle to reach goals that are “arduous and difficult to obtain”—hardly a walk in the park. Modern psychologists have followed suit, describing hope as a bulwark against despair in difficult times.So how does it work? And more importantly, how can it be used to affect change in our lives and across our culture?Hope contains three experiences. First, a goal, something positive that may or may not occur in the future. Second, will power, the desire to achieve that goal, and third, way power, a path through which to pursue it. Where an optimist might sit and wait for a bright future to arrive, a hopeful person pulls themselves towards it, often through great effort. And because of that, hope—more than optimism—predicts people’s ability to meet their goals.If you’re upset by this year’s election, you can use hope in at least two ways. First, it can steady your well being. Research finds that hopeful people are more resilient when facing difficulties, such as chronic illness and loss. Amid a swirl of experiences we can’t control, hope focuses us on what we can. Restoring a sense of agency, it can bring peace, purpose, and strength.This is not merely an exercise in wellness. The energy hope provides has been a cornerstone of social movements around the world and throughout history. Psychologists have examined decades of research collective action, people’s willingness to struggle together for causes in which they believe. One of the forces that most propelled collective action was a sense of efficacy. People fight when they imagine the fight could be won. In other words, when they feel hope.One source of efficacy—and hope—among activists is the knowledge that even when systems are unjust and harmful, most people are not. After his release from prison, Havel got right back into the advocacy that had gotten him arrested in the first place. But he was not alone. His dissident group, Charter 77, led national strikes and demonstrations that swelled to hundreds of thousands of people. With the media under state control, citizens hung handmade protest signs from their windows. Each risked their safety, but also signaled to each other how popular the movement was.  Within a few years, the regime had toppled, and Havel became the Czech Republic’s first President.  Now, too, good citizens are everywhere. Conservative voters are wrong about crime statistics, but both sides misunderstand each other. Research clearly demonstrates that more than 80% of Americans—including Democrats and Republicans voters—would prefer greater peace between political parties; most respect democratic rule. Across surveys, a supermajority of the country support policies to protect poor people and the climate. But almost no one knows that. Both Democrats and Republicans vastly overestimate how extreme, hateful, anti-democratic, and violent their opponents are. Media companies thrive on outrage, inundating us with extreme and inflammatory portrayals of the “other side.” When we uncritically consume these messages, we miss out on vast swaths of common ground that most Americans share.  Succumbing to cynicism might feel like a balm after this election, but it’s a trap—one that leads us further from the solutions we need. Instead, we must embrace the hard work of hope: recognizing our shared humanity, seeking common ground, and building a coalition that transcends divides. This isn’t wishful thinking; it’s strategic, deliberate, and essential.In their walk through the wilderness, Democrats will need to consider how to build a broader coalition that can defeat the cynical populism of Trump and his successors. In this mission, hope isn’t just a mindset—it’s the plan.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

ice President Kamala Harris formally conceded in a speech Wednesday afternoon at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she urged her followers to continue fighting for democracy. Former President Donald Trump will be serving a second term after he was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election early Wednesday by the Associated Press.The following transcript was prepared and provided to TIME by Rev, using AI-powered software, and it was reviewed and edited for accuracy by TIME staff.-Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good—Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, good afternoon. Thank you all.Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So let me say (crowd screams love you), and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials I thank you. I thank you all. Look, I am so proud of the race we ran. And the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign—the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways: in how we live our lives by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor, by always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But, like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. And the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it.  To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay. On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look, many of you know I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives.  People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage a historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. Make God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. I thank you all. CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Election officials are under siege.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.When melissa kono, the town clerk in Burnside, Wisconsin, began training election workers in 2015, their questions were relatively mundane. They asked about election rules, voter eligibility, and other basic procedures. The job was gratifying and enjoyable; they helped their neighbors while sipping coffee.But over the past few years, everything has changed. Kono now finds herself fielding questions about what to do when approached by suspicious voters who ask provocative questions or gripe about fraud. She’s added an entire training section dedicated to identifying threats and how to report them. “I never in a million years imagined that that would be part of my curriculum,” she told me. Kono has yet to receive any direct threats herself—perhaps, she thinks, because Donald Trump won the popular vote in her area in 2016 and 2020—but she fears that things may be different this time around. “What I do hear is I know the election is not rigged here, but in other places,” she said. “And I’m honestly worried sometimes: What if Harris wins? What if it gets too close? And now they start questioning me or coming after me, when I have nothing to do with the outcome.”Around the country, election officials have already received death threats and packages filled with white powder. Their dogs have been poisoned, their homes swatted, their family members targeted. In Texas, one man called for a “a mass shooting of poll workers and election officials” in precincts with results he found suspicious. “The point is coercion; the point is intimidation. It’s to get you to do or not do something,” Al Schmidt, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, told me—to get you to “stop counting votes, or we’re going to murder your children, and they name your children,” a threat that Schmidt said he received in 2020. This year, the same things may well happen again. “I had one election official who said they called her on her cellphone and said, ‘Looks like your mom made lasagna tonight; she’s wearing that pretty yellow dress that she likes to wear to church,” Tammy Patrick, the chief programs officer at the National Association of Election Officials and a former elections officer in Maricopa County, Arizona, told me. “It’s terrorism here in America.”These workers, from secretaries of state to local officials to volunteers, are bearing the immediate, human toll of a campaign to discredit the integrity of American democracy. They are the most direct and vulnerable targets for people who have embraced conspiracy theories about fraudulent and “stolen” votes following the 2020 election—unfounded claims that have been directly promoted by Trump and many other members of the Republican Party, who still will not accept that he lost his first reelection bid. Where candidates used to compete against each other, Schmidt told me, some are now “attacking the referees.” In the most extreme narratives, election workers are accused of fabricating, shredding, or double-counting ballots, which leads to suspicion and harassment. “Since the 2020 election, we have seen an unprecedented spike in threats against the public servants who do administer our elections,” including shootings and a bomb threat, Attorney General Merrick Garland said last month. A survey conducted in February and March by the Brennan Center for Justice found that 38 percent of election officials reported being harassed, abused, or threatened—up from 30 percent a year earlier.This is not just a story about assaults on individual workers, although that would be bad enough. Election administration is “underappreciated as the foundation upon which all of our representative government thrives,” Rachel Orey, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center Elections Project, told me. In a very real way, these officials represent the soul of democracy. Many of them are undertaking their duties while also juggling child care and everyday errands such as grocery shopping. Without their diligence, nobody could be elected, period. The form of government that Americans recognize and celebrate could not exist.Dissuading or preventing people from going to, or otherwise attempting to interfere with, the polls are century-old dirty tactics, and there are all manner of legal ways to suppress or dilute the vote, many of which target racial minorities. But Trump’s attempts to unilaterally dictate election results are different. As far back as 2012, he criticized Barack Obama’s reelection as a “total sham and a travesty.” Victory in 2016, and the conversion or defeat of nearly all of his Republican rivals, gave Trump the power to mount a serious and systematic attempt to discredit the democratic process. He and his furious supporters, in turn, have unleashed a sustained assault on national and state elections alike.“I wasn’t aware of any real threats or harassment or wide-scale verbal abuse on election officials prior to the 2020 election cycle,” Tina Barton, the vice chair of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, told me. The outrage and attacks that emerged in 2020 have now been harnessed into a well-funded campaign: Republicans have reportedly donated upwards of $100 million to a network of so-called election-integrity groups to lay the groundwork for contesting the results should Trump lose again. Although poll watching is itself normal, the GOP is training and deploying armies of monitors with the presumption of fraud, flooding election offices with public-records requests, and filing endless challenges to voter-registration records. “I don’t think there’s any question that there is a more coordinated and sophisticated effort ahead of this election to discredit it than there was in 2020,” Lawrence Norden, the vice president of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, told me.This election cycle, one of the “dominant narratives” is about noncitizen voting, Thessalia Merivaki, a political scientist at Georgetown University who studies how election officials combat misinformation, told me. Republican activists, politicians, lawmakers, and pundits have especially seized on false fears about immigrant and foreign voting to burnish a conspiracy theory that noncitizen votes from overseas will turn the election. These claims have been widely debunked, but all the energy behind them could delay vote counts and disenfranchise citizens. Republican groups are filing more and more lawsuits in battleground states about voter-identification requirements, absentee ballots, and other basic procedures, “setting up an opportunity afterwards to cast doubt on the election results,” Norden said.When I began reporting this article, I was curious about whether election officials had concerns over new technologies. The internet has changed substantially since 2020. For the past couple of years, I’ve written about the rise of generative AI and its attendant issues: In terms that are most directly relevant to the election, that means the arrival of easy-to-create and highly convincing deepfakes, the concoction of micro-targeted conspiracy theories, the overall degradation of our information environment, and the possibility that our sense of shared reality might be wiped out altogether. It’s easy to imagine that AI could wreak havoc around Election Day—earlier this year, a robocall that cloned President Joe Biden’s voice was used in a voter-suppression effort—and experts have made their concerns about the technology clear.The election workers and officials I spoke with did express worry about AI and its ability to accelerate disinformation and election-interference campaigns. But they also described problems that came from more familiar sources. They spoke with me about how videos of entirely proper and legal election procedures—snippets of livestreamed election procedures, for instance—had been miscontextualized to suggest that officials who were simply following the rules were actually smuggling in ballots, rigging voting machines, or otherwise manipulating the results. Blatantly false headlines and incendiary posts spreading on messaging apps and among social-media groups have done and continue to do plenty of damage. Sometimes, the details are irrelevant. As my colleague Charlie Warzel recently wrote, manipulated media and misinformation is useful not necessarily because it convinces some population of undecided suckers, but because it allows the already aggrieved to sequester themselves in a parallel reality. A voter might say, “Let’s just set the facts aside,” Patrick, of the National Association of Election Officials, told me, “and I’m going to tell you what I think or what I feel about this.”Amy Burgans, the clerk-treasurer in Douglas County, Nevada, herself had doubts about the outcome of the 2020 election when she started in her role that December. (The previous clerk-treasurer had resigned—the pandemic and contentious election cycle, Burgans told me, had been “a lot.”) Burgans said that she had heard in the news, on social media, and from people she knew that there “must have been” some foul play. But once she was in charge of running elections and administered the 2022 midterms, she said, she saw the rigor at every step of the process and understood that the allegations of widespread, systemic fraud were impossible.Now she’s the one fielding questions, frequently about voting machines. Burgans has explained to voters all of the controls in place, that she’s “never seen even one error” after an election audit. Still, people ask her about election procedures at almost every event she attends, or “even if I’m at the Elks Club just hanging out,” she said. Burgans said she has “no issues with” and tries to address these questions. But doing so takes time and energy—and these comments are just the tip of the spear.Burgans received a threat in the mail in 2022. Although it was mostly a broad rant about the government, it did make her worry for her children’s safety, and she installed a security system in her home. Her county’s election facilities are stocked with personal protective equipment and Narcan, in the event of suspicious substances or powders (which might be fentanyl) arriving in the mail—something that has already happened at election offices in several states. She also recently installed bulletproof glass in the office, where Burgans and full-time staff work—as a precaution rather than a response to any particular threat, she said. Election deniers are “consistently coming into [election] offices saying things like ‘You’d better watch your back’ or ‘Don’t you forget: I know where your kids go to school,” Barton, the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections vice chair, told me. What was unprecedented in 2020, Barton said, is now an “ongoing onslaught.”This attack on american elections is not an invasion so much as a siege. And just as hateful, outlandish, and conspiracist misinformation have eroded Americans’ trust in one another, institutions, and basic facts, this environment is taking a psychic toll on election workers. They find themselves having to put in extra hours to field questions, accommodate an influx of poll watchers, process voter challenges, sort through public-records requests, and prepare for any emergencies and attacks—all while fearing for their safety. For more than two decades, running an election has become steadily more complex and involved. After 2000’s infamous hanging chads, election workers had to become IT professionals. After long lines became a key issue in 2008 and 2012, they became logistics experts. After 2016, they learned cybersecurity, and in advance of 2020, they studied public-health protocols and how to process enormous quantities of mail-in ballots. Now election workers have to be communications experts as well. “We’ve had poll watchers in here every single day since September 26,” when early voting began, “sometimes three or four of them in a small space,” Aaron Ammons, the clerk and recorder of deeds in Champaign County, Illinois, said in a recent press briefing.Meanwhile, support and resources for these emerging responsibilities are frequently missing. The result, inevitably, is burnout: The job keeps getting harder and requiring more hours, but resources for hiring, buying new equipment, improving security, and more have been inconsistent and haphazard. “There have been new challenges and new expectations put on election administrators, but funding hasn’t kept pace,” Rachel Orey said. Hours spent on election work have ballooned since 2020, according to a recent national survey of election workers conducted by Reed College. Meanwhile, nearly one-third of election offices don’t have any full-time staff, wages are pitiful, and turnover rates grew from 28 percent in 2004—already high—to nearly 39 percent in 2022.This burden “has taken away from [election officials’] ability to just focus on the mechanics of that very important election,” Kim Wyman, a former secretary of state for Washington who recently served as a senior election-security adviser at the Department of Homeland Security, told me. Skeptics will use innocent mistakes and logistical snares—which are mundane and easily rectified—and even the act of correcting “as gasoline on the fire to ‘prove’ their point or their claim of voter fraud,” she said. This, in turn, only fuels the exhaustion. “People just make up stuff about what we do and are coming after us,” Kono, of Wisconsin, told me. She’s seen many longtime clerks and election workers leave, telling her, “I can’t do another presidential election” and “I don’t want to have to deal with voters.”Those who remain do not take the job lightly. In 20 years working in election administration, Barton told me, “I have never seen election officials train so much in four years’ time”—improving security, being transparent at every step of the process, speaking at events and posting on social media to educate their communities. They’ve been preparing for November 5, 2024, for four years, Wyman told me. “This is my Olympics,” Kono said.The misinformation crisis is commonly understood as a clash between two “realities” that is most visible online, in the words of high-profile politicians, or during spectacular flashpoints such as the January 6 Capitol riot. But for four years, and especially in the weeks leading up to and after November 5, these battles have and will be quotidian and interpersonal. “We are your soccer coaches. We are the moms helping at the schools, the dads coaching baseball, the grandmothers that are going on field trips,” Burgans said. This everyday warfare, waged against the neighbors and teachers and elders and bus drivers who administer the polls, and in turn democracy, may be more consequential than any single vote or outcome.More StoriesAI’s Fingerprints Were All Over the ElectionThe Great Conspiracy-Theorist Flip-Flop

CONTENT: After a bruising election, many Americans may feel an impulse toward solitude. That’s the wrong instinct.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.One month to the day before the 2024 presidential election, The New York Times reported on a new analysis of how Americans spend their time. More and more of the average American’s day is being spent at home: one hour and 39 minutes more in 2022 than in 2003. For each extra hour at home, a bit of it was spent with family—7.4 minutes. More of it, 21 minutes, was spent alone.Obviously, because of the coronavirus pandemic, time at home spiked in 2020. Some of this homebody impulse may well be the stubborn persistence of habits formed during the isolating early days of lockdown. But this trend is more than just a pandemic hangover. For years before COVID-19 hit, time spent alone had been increasing as time spent socializing had been decreasing. Though solitude and loneliness are not the same, this downturn in social connection happened alongside a rise in loneliness so pronounced that the surgeon general called it an epidemic.And now this: the reelection to the nation’s highest office of Donald Trump, a man who has attacked the very idea of a communal, democratic form of government, and who has indicated that he aspires to move the United States toward autocracy—auto, of course, meaning “self,” and autocracy being the concentration of power for and within the self. Self over others is one of Trump’s defining principles. In his first term as president, he used an office intended for public service to enrich himself. He has vowed to use it this time to take revenge on his enemies and—“within two seconds” of taking office—to fire the special counsel overseeing criminal cases against him.Yet self over others, or at the very least self before others, has long been a prominent aspect of American culture—not always to Trumpian levels, certainly, but individualism for better and worse shapes both the structure of society and our personal lives. And it will surely shape Americans’ responses to the election: for the winners, perhaps, self-congratulation; for the losers, the risk of allowing despair to pull them into a deeper, more dangerous seclusion. On Election Day, the Times published an article on voters’ plans to manage stress. Two separate people in that story said they were deliberately avoiding social settings. To extend that strategy into the next four years would be a mistake.Read: Don’t give up on AmericaIn 1831, the French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville traveled to the United States. He observed and analyzed its people and culture, and published his thoughts in a massive two-volume report called Democracy in America. Alongside his praise for the country’s professed value of equality—which he wrote “possesses all the characteristics of a divine decree”—he warned of the individualism he saw as baked into American society and the isolation it could cause. “Each man is forever thrown back on himself alone,” he wrote, “and there is danger that he may be shut up in the solitude of his own heart.”More than a century and a half later, Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life, a sociological book by five scholars, followed explicitly in Tocqueville’s footsteps, examining how individualism affects institutions and personal relationships in the United States. Published in 1985, it reads today as wildly prescient. The authors feared that the danger Tocqueville described had already come to pass. “It seems to us,” they wrote, “that it is individualism, and not equality, as Tocqueville thought, that has marched inexorably through our history. We are concerned that this individualism may have grown cancerous … that it may be threatening the survival of freedom itself.”Tempering American individualism, in Tocqueville’s view, was Americans’ propensity to form associations and participate in civic life. “These he saw as moderating the isolating tendencies of private ambition on one hand and limiting the despotic proclivities of government on the other,” the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote. But American associational life began hollowing out starting in the 1960s and ’70s, as people became less and less likely to attend any kind of club, league, church, or other community organization (a shift that Robert Putnam documented in his 2000 book, Bowling Alone). Since the late ’70s, faith in large-scale institutions such as organized religion, organized labor, the media, and the U.S. government has also been dwindling; in 2023, Gallup declared it “historically low.”A few months ago I spoke with Ann Swidler, one of the authors of Habits of the Heart. “We obviously did not succeed in having things go the direction we might have hoped,” she told me. “I would say that every horrible thing we worried about has gotten worse.” Americans are spending measurably more time shut up in the solitude of their homes, and perhaps in the solitude of their own hearts as well.It might be difficult to imagine the renaissance of many civic associations—the kind that could be good for both democracy and our relationships—given that a majority of Americans just voted for a man who has little interest in or respect for institutions beyond what they can do for him. If autocracy is indeed where the country is headed, Tocqueville’s prediction regarding our relationships is not a positive one. As he wrote in The Old Regime and the Revolution, his book on the French revolution:Despotism does not combat this tendency [toward individualism]; on the contrary, it renders it irresistible, for it deprives citizens of all common passions, mutual necessities, need of a common understanding, opportunity for combined action: it ripens them, so to speak, in private life. They had a tendency to hold themselves aloof from each other: it isolates them. They looked coldly on each other: it freezes their souls.If individualism is, as the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote, “the first language in which Americans tend to think about their lives,” it makes sense that people would reach for their mother tongue in times of upheaval. In the days after the 2016 election, for example, searches for the term self-care spiked. Caring for yourself takes different forms, of course, though in mainstream culture, self-care is commonly used to mean treating yourself, by yourself. Self-soothing, alone. (One can see in this echoes of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay “Self-Reliance”: “Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.”)But caring for yourself doesn’t always have to breed isolation. Among activists and in the helping professions, self-care is often talked about as a way to restore people so that they don’t burn out and can continue their altruistic work. Some in these circles critique a focus on self-care as distracting from the need for institutional support. But the overall conception at least shows an understanding of the two types of care as having a symbiotic relationship: Care for the self so that you can show up for others.Read: Focus on the things that matterWhat’s more, caring for others is a form of self-care. Research shows that doing things for other people leads to greater well-being than trying to make yourself happy or indulging yourself. This is not to say there is no place for self-soothing or solitude, or for buying yourself a little treat. But it is to challenge the cultural message that turtling up alone is the most appropriate response to difficult feelings.Under an administration for which (to paraphrase my colleague Adam Serwer) cruelty, not care, is the point, it falls to people to care for one another on scales small and large. This task is made harder not just by the cultural pressure for Americans to rely only on themselves but also by the slow, steady atrophying of the muscles of togetherness. “American individualism resists more adult virtues, such as care and generativity, let alone wisdom,” the authors of Habits of the Heart wrote. The inverse, I hope, is true too: that care and generativity—working to make contributions to a collective future—are the path to resisting hyper-individualism and isolation.Even if turning inward is a big-picture trend, it is, of course, not the only development happening. As isolating as the pandemic lockdown was, those years saw the rise of mutual-aid groups determined to care for the vulnerable whether the government did or not. During the first Trump administration, mass protests broke out; people fought for women’s rights and an end to racist police brutality. People are always showing up for one another in quiet, everyday ways too. Building networks of support and commitment could provide some small buffer against the effects of a self-serving president-elect’s policies while keeping people from drifting further apart.Americans’ skills of connection and care are not lost. But they are rusty. And all of us will need those skills if we are to find a way to turn toward one another instead of inward. I’m not even talking about overcoming political polarization or reaching out to build bridges with strangers who voted differently than you did. Those are tasks that people won’t be equipped to tackle if they’re struggling to show up for the loved ones already in their life. For now, it is enough of a challenge to attempt to reverse the isolationist inertia of decades. It is enough of a challenge to resist what has become a cultural tendency to withdraw, while also processing the stress of an election that has left many people exhausted and deeply afraid for the future. How do we proceed over the next four years? Not alone. How do we proceed over the next week, hour, minute? Not alone.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

CONTENT: The man accused of killing 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley has been sentenced to life in prison, in a case that became a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential election.A judge in Georgia found Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, guilty of murder and other charges related to Ms Riley's death.Prosecutors argued that Ibarra killed the student on 22 February this year after going “hunting for females” on the University of Georgia (UGA) campus.Ms Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family cried as the verdict was read. Ibarra did not visibly react.Ibarra’s lawyers had argued that evidence linking him to Ms Riley’s death was “circumstantial”.Ms Riley, who lived in the city of Athens, north-east Georgia, was found dead in a wooded area of the UGA campus after she did not return from her morning run.Ibarra was arrested a day later.On Wednesday, he was found guilty of all 10 counts, including felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury and aggravated assault with intent to rape.Ibarra had waived his right to a jury trial, which means his case was heard and decided by county Judge H Patrick Haggard.He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, as prosecutors had requested.Prosecutors told the court Ibarra saw Riley while she was running on the UGA campus and "bashed her skull in with a rock".Data from Ms Riley's smartwatch showed she had "fought for her life, fought for her dignity" only minutes after departing on her run, the trial heard.The victim's struggle was "fierce", the lead prosecutor said. Ms Riley called police at 09:11 that morning and her heart stopped at 09:28, with no more movement from her device.Ibarra's lawyer had argued there was a lack of proof connecting his client to Ms Riley's death.But prosecutors said evidence showed that Ibarra's DNA was found under the nails of Ms Riley, indicating a struggle between them.The trial, which began last Friday, included testimony from more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Ms Riley's former roommate and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.Rosbeli Flores-Bello, Ibarra's former roommate, testified that the two had travelled together from New York City, where they had been living in a migrant shelter, to Georgia in search of work.Ibarra entered the US illegally on 8 September 2022, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was later released for further processing.ICE has said that Ibarra was arrested in New York City in September 2023 and was charged with "acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation".He was released by the NYPD, ICE officials said.Ms Riley's name became a rallying cry for conservatives as border security emerged as a defining issue in the White House race.In March, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was heckled over her murder during his State of the Union address to Congress.Republican lawmakers said it was the White House's fault that Ibarra was able to remain in the country despite his criminal record.President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, often invoked Ms Riley's name on the campaign trail.Trump reacted to Ibarra's guilty verdict, writing on Truth Social that he hopes the outcome of the trial "can bring some peace and closure to her wonderful family who fought for justice"."It is time to secure our border," Trump added.A National Institute of Justice study suggests that undocumented migrants in the US are arrested for violent and drug crimes at less than half the rate of native-born citizens.Screams of joy erupted outside court as winners of a public lottery to attend the hearing stepped forward with their lucky tickets.The end of the federal cases marks the most tangible consequence of Trump's return to political power.Jane Rubens' family say they faced accepting her return to the UK or having her insurance cancelled.Top colleges have issued travel advisories urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.Jill Biden, accompanied by her grandson Beau, welcomed the arrival of the festive fir hailing from North Carolina.

CONTENT: By Bill ChappellA Pennsylvania state elector casts his vote in the 2020 presidential election in Harrisburg on Dec. 14, 2020.Every presidential election cycle, constitutional law expert Alison LaCroix can count on people asking her one question when they learn what she does for a living.“Why do we have the Electoral College?” she says she's asked — again and again. “It's good news in terms of people being aware that it exists,” says LaCroix, who teaches law and history at the University of Chicago, “but bad news in the sense that people feel like, ‘Why does it exist, and is it useful?’”A majority of Americans — more than 60% — support abolishing the Electoral College, according to a September report by the Pew Research Center. But the system has survived an unprecedented number of attempts to change it.“There have been more proposals for Constitutional amendments on changing the Electoral College than on any other subject,” according to the National Archives, citing more than 700 efforts to dismantle the process.Backers of the Electoral College idea say the system balances power among large and small states, brings stability, and is an obstacle to demagogues. But critics call the Electoral College an indirect process that’s undemocratic and rooted in racism. It’s also the reason we have swing states.“From the perspective of 2024, you know, it doesn't seem ‘small-d’ democratic to have this sort of intermediate body between the people voting and the ultimate decision,” says LaCroix, who has written a historical analysis of the U.S. Constitution.Here’s a quick guide:Dec. 16, 1940: New York State electors, part of the Electoral College, cast votes at the state capital in Albany. "All are unidentified," according to The Associated Press.“When voters cast their ballots for a candidate for president of the United States, they are actually voting for the presidential electors who were selected by that candidate’s party,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.On ballots around the country, names like “Donald Trump” and “Kamala Harris” actually represent slates of electors — members of the Electoral College who are pledged to vote for that candidate.There are 538 members of the Electoral College nationwide: one for each state’s members of Congress, and three more for the District of Columbia. That’s where the presidential election’s famous number comes from: The candidate with at least 270 electoral votes (a majority) wins. As we’ve seen in some previous elections, that candidate doesn’t have to win the popular vote.Despite its substantial-sounding name, the Electoral College is neither a place nor a permanent body: It’s more of a process. In each state, political parties designate their own slate of potential electors before the November general election.Nearly every state and the District of Columbia have a winner-take-all policy, meaning only those electors tied to a candidate who won the popular vote in their state will send their ballots to the Capitol. Maine and Nebraska divide the ballots, giving two “at-large” electoral votes to the state’s overall winner but also one for each congressional district won.The electors then gather in mid-December to cast their votes for president and vice president, sending the results to Congress.Congress then certifies the votes, on Jan. 6. If there’s a tie, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to choose the president.A presidential candidate can win the Electoral College vote but lose the popular vote: it happened in 2016 and 2000, and several times in the 1800s.In most states, the two main parties choose slates of potential electors either at their conventions or by committee votes. They’re often people who play prominent roles in state government or are longstanding party members.Each state’s legislature determines how electors are chosen — but there are two main restrictions: They can’t be federal government workers; and they can’t be members of Congress.Federal law doesn’t require electors to vote in a way that reflects that results in their state, but 37 states have laws requiring them to do so, according to the NCSL. The organization says the 2016 election saw seven “faithless” electors — including five Democratic electors who refused to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton — the most since 1972.Despite their power, electors’ identities aren’t usually widely known outside of their state. Unlike members of Congress, there isn’t a centralized list of all the states’ electors, according to the Office of the Federal Register.Jan. 6, 2021: Then-President Trump's supporters march at the Michigan State Capitol to protest the certification of Joe Biden as the next U.S. president.The country’s framers saw the Electoral College as a way to balance a lot of competing motivations, from the separation of federal powers to states not wanting to cede power, to concerns of unequal power between the states due to population differences (and for some, not wanting to risk losing slavery). LaCroix says even at the time, in the 1780s when this decision was made at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, the delegates chose “an unusual body.”The Constitution’s framers were also dubious about a popular vote, concerned on one hand that the country was too large for the public to make an informed choice on a leader — and on the other, that a direct system could help a demagogue rise to power.They also considered, but dismissed, the idea of having Congress choose the president, similar to Great Britain’s parliamentary system. But at the Convention, Gouverneur Morris — who argued for a popular vote — warned that if the legislature picked the president, “it will be the work of intrigue, of cabal, and of faction.”But some Convention attendees also believed candidates would likely fail to gain national support outside their region, leaving Congress to decide the presidency.“And then they say, well, what about an intermediate body, which becomes the Electoral College,” LaCroix says. “[It] solves the problem of the president being too beholden to Congress. It's a temporary body. It's not some entity that has ongoing power. And they thought that was appealing.”A further sign of the Electoral College’s ephemeral nature: The term isn’t mentioned in the Constitution.Dec. 13, 2000: Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore march to the Florida State Capitol to rally against the legislature's intention to name a slate of electors favorable to Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.At the Convention, Southern states successfully argued for using enslaved people’s population numbers to bolster their power in Congress, claiming that each slave should be counted as 3/5 of a person — but not have the right to vote — when calculating representation.A direct popular vote for the presidency would undermine that power. But if the Electoral College were to be based on representation in Congress, the Three Fifths Compromise’s amplification of Southern political power would carry over into choosing the president. The dynamic has been a force in presidential elections ever since.“That's a problem with the Electoral College today, is it just sort of refracts too much power to small states,” LaCroix says. “And some of it is about smaller states — or states that were, like Georgia and South Carolina, really concerned about protecting slavery” in the new Constitution.The Civil War and the 13th Amendment ended the Three Fifths era. But for decades afterward, Southern states worked to suppress and dilute Black voters’ impact. Today, the Electoral College’s critics say that its winner-take-all aspect is still harmful.“You see the impact, for example, in the South right now,” Jesse Wegman, author of the book Let The People Pick The President: The Case For Abolishing The Electoral College, told NPR’s Fresh Air in 2020. Wegman says millions of Black citizens’ votes in Southern states are simply drowned out by white majorities.“You see these patterns replicating themselves throughout our history,” he said. “The people who stopped the popular vote amendment in the late 1960s were Southern segregationists. Some of the people who prevented us from getting to a popular vote in the founding of the country were slave holders. Again and again the pattern repeats itself.”Nov. 13, 2016: Protestors demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The Republican lost the popular vote by more than a million votes, but he won the Electoral College vote.Going back more than 50 years, a majority of voters have supported doing away with the Electoral College.“Public opinion polls have shown Americans favored abolishing it by majorities of 58 percent in 1967; 81 percent in 1968; and 75 percent in 1981,” according to the National Archives.Momentum to replace the Electoral College got a boost in 1968, when Richard Nixon notched a razor-thin win of the popular vote — after earlier concerns that segregationist George Wallace’s third-party candidacy might siphon enough electoral votes to prevent a clear majority.Sen. Birch Bayh led a push to amend the Constitution, and in September of 1969, the House voted 339–70 to adopt the measure. But the amendment languished in the Senate.“Led by Southern senators but helped by some very conservative Midwestern Republicans, the proposal is defeated by a filibuster,” as Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar told NPR’s Throughline ahead of the 2020 election.Segregationists weren’t the only ones who wanted to preserve the Electoral College. Some Black leaders, such as Vernon Jordan, argued in the 1970s that Black voters could wield political power as “swing” election deciders. But many of those leaders later opted to support a popular vote.The college’s supporters include the conservative Heritage Foundation, which says it prevents presidential candidates from focusing only on winning votes from high-population and urban areas, thus addressing “the Founders’ fears of a ‘tyranny of the majority,” according to its website.The Heritage Foundation also says the Electoral College tends to magnify the margin of victory, imparting a mandate to govern; and “has the added benefit of eschewing radical candidates for more moderate ones.”Even experts who want change also warn that some of the impacts could be unpredictable.For instance, Akhil Reed Amar, a law professor at Yale University, told NPR’s Throughline that running a new, national direct election would bring complications — from what central federal authority oversees it to how to get 50 states to agree on the rules.But, Amar added, “Here's my best argument for why we should have reform: equality. One person, one vote. Each person's vote should count the same…. One person, one vote is a powerful affirmation of equality.”In the face of high federal hurdles such as a constitutional amendment, there is a push for change at the state level.Under the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, states adopt legislation requiring them to award their electors’ votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote nationwide. The mechanism would kick in once enough states join the compact to decide a presidential election.As of this year, National Popular Vote legislation has become law in 17 states and D.C., reflecting 209 electoral votes. In 2023, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed his state’s version of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. This year, Maine also joined the group.The legislation “has also passed at least one legislative chamber in 7 states possessing 74 electoral votes (Arkansas, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, Virginia),” according to the National Popular Vote website.The compact needs to add states holding 61 more electoral votes to trigger the change.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

he 2024 presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris comes to a head Tuesday on Election Day. The winner won’t be decided by the number of votes cast in their favor but by a group of 538 people that make up the Electoral College.“When you go vote for President, you do not vote for President,” says William Field, political science professor at Rutgers University. Instead, you are voting for that party’s electors, who typically cast a vote in favor of the presidential candidate that wins the most votes in that state.It's a process that dates back centuries and has proven controversial, particularly in instances when a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. Most recently, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite earning nearly 3 million votes less overall, marking the fifth time in U.S. history that a candidate has become President without winning the most votes. Sixty-three percent of Americans say that they would prefer it if the winner of the presidential election were decided by the popular vote, according to a Pew Research Center 2024 report, though there are partisan divides. Eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters are in favor of abolishing the Electoral College compared to 46% of Republicans. Despite the more than 700 proposals introduced in Congress to reform or get rid of the Electoral College, according to the National Archives, it remains in place today. Under the Electoral College, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are allocated a certain number of electoral votes equal to their two senators and their number of representatives. Since representatives are based on the population of a state, that means larger states, like California and Texas, have the highest number of electoral votes at 54 and 40. Five states—Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming—have the least electoral votes at three. The election is essentially decided state-by-state. If a candidate wins the popular vote in a state, typically, they receive all of the states electoral college votes—even if the race is close.But in Maine and Nebraska, there are split electoral votes, which means two electoral votes are given to the state’s popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote goes out to the popular vote winner per congressional district. In total, there are 538 electors who will cast a vote in favor of a particular presidential candidate. In order to win the presidential election, candidates must receive a majority of the possible 538 votes, or at least 270 votes. After voters cast their ballots on Election Day, races are eventually called in every state, with the first results starting to come in on Election Day. States have until Dec. 10 to finalize any disputes or finish recounts over the results. On Dec. 17, electors meet to cast their ballots for President. The copies of the ballots are then sent to the president of the U.S. Senate, or Vice President to officially be counted. On Jan. 6, Congress meets to count the electoral votes and certify victory for the candidate who has received at least 270.If no presidential candidate gets 270 votes, then Congress will elect the President and Vice President. Each state’s House representatives will cast a ballot in favor of one candidate. In this scenario, a candidate must earn at least 26 votes to win the presidency. The Senate elects the Vice President. Each Senator casts one vote for a vice presidential candidate, and whoever receives 51 votes will be elected. If the House of Representatives does not elect a president by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, then the Vice-President elect becomes the interim President until the House comes to a decision.The rules for the Electoral College are outlined in the 12th Amendment of the Constitution. Because democracy was a new idea at the time, says Field, the nation’s founders thought it would be best to have the states elect a President rather than voters directly. This decision was part of the checks and balances system prevalent throughout the American political system, but it also reflected the Founding Fathers’ lack of trust in voters, says John Sacher, a history professor at the University of Central Florida.“They wanted property owning white men to vote,” he says. “They wanted to make sure that people were virtuous who voted. They were concerned that if you allow the people too much power, that the people might choose poorly.”The logistics at the time also made it more difficult to get people to cast their ballot during a period with reduced and slower transportation, lower literacy rates, and limited opportunities for education. In fact, it was not until the election of 1824 that eligible voters, not just electors, cast a ballot for the next leader of the U.S.  Read More: The Debate That Gave Us the Electoral CollegeSlavery also played a role in the establishment of the Electoral College when delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention agreed on the so-called three-fifths compromise in determining representation in the House. “In order to distribute the number of congressional seats and therefore the electoral votes, they would count an enslaved person as three-fifths of a human being,” says Field. “They couldn't vote, but it boosted the seeming population of those states that had large numbers of lay people.” This made it so that those in the North would not wield significantly more power than those in the South, where many people remained enslaved. Electors are selected by each political party, but the guidelines vary by state. Guidelines that apply to all states include that no senator, representative, or person who holds an “office of trust or profit in the U.S.” can be an elector. State officials who have previously held an “insurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid and comfort to its enemies” are also disqualified. While electors often vote for the presidential candidate they have pledged to vote for, sometimes “faithless electors,” do not do so. In 2016, seven electors went rogue—the most since 1972, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-five states and D.C. have laws against faithless electors. Violation of these laws could lead to fines or elector disqualification depending on the state. In New Mexico and South Carolina, faithless electors could face a criminal penalty. But, these faithless actors have never changed the outcome of an election.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: By Leila Fadel, Ziad Buchh, Arezou RezvaniPro-Palestinian supporters hold a candlelight vigil in Dearborn, Mich., on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza.DEARBORN, Mich. — This city, home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the country, is a city in deep mourning over two wars in the Middle East thousands of miles away.The signs of that grief are everywhere.At a funeral for a Lebanese American man killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon.At a candlelight vigil where people bowed their heads in prayer.And on the walls of a local coffee shop and art gallery, Black Box, covered in the colors of Lebanese and Palestinian flags. Playing cards with pictures of President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are also taped up, each marked with the words “war criminal.”Lisa Alcodray speaks with a customer about the exhibition inside the Black Box cafe on Oct. 10 in Dearborn, Mich.Many residents here have loved ones who have been killed in Lebanon and Gaza. They say they feel betrayed by the Democratic Party over the administration’s continued military support for Israel despite global alarm over the level of civilians killed and suffering.They’re trying to figure out how to express this pain at the ballot box in less than a week.Back in February, a self-described anti-war coalition called the Uncommitted Movement, led by Arab and Muslim American Democrats, rallied voters to send a message to President Biden: get a cease-fire, stop sending weapons to Israel, or risk losing voters in Michigan.More than 100,000 voters heeded the call during the Democratic primary and checked “uncommitted” on the ballot.Today, Biden is no longer the Democratic candidate, and Vice President Harris is at the top of the ticket. However, for those who chose "uncommitted" — the majority of whom have voted Democratic in the past — support for Harris is by no means guaranteed in this key swing state, where she and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck.All these months later, there is no cease-fire in Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. In fact, it’s expanded to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Calls to end or condition U.S. military aid to Israel over the level of civilians killed and infrastructure destroyed have gone largely unheeded.“It’s such a tough moment. It feels like a moment of impossibility,” said Abbas Alawieh, the co-founder of the Uncommitted Movement and a Democratic organizer. “I'm feeling a certain level of despair, and I'm also feeling the contradictions of that despair being so rooted in the policy of our government to send weapons and bombs to kill people I love.”The unity that was so apparent in February among Arab Americans, young voters and other progressives in the Detroit metro area has fractured, and people are divided on how to express their objections to U.S. policy with their limited political power come Election Day.Abbas Alawieh is still choosing Harris. "I've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?" Alawieh said on Oct. 1.“When [Harris] became the candidate, we made this offer that if you change the policy, then we’ll automatically endorse you, and if you can’t change the policy then give us something,” Alawieh said, his face pale and his hands shaking as he spoke in a Dearborn cafe. “Not only did they not give us anything, they actively worked to push voters for whom this is a top issue away.”The inability to get anything from Harris has diminished the credibility of this movement in the view of so many in his own community, home to the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Their families hail from the cities and towns being bombed by Israel right now. More than 2,700 people have been killed in a matter of weeks and over a million displaced, according to the country's Health Ministry.Despite Alawieh’s pain over the deaths of his own family members in Lebanon and his displaced loved ones, he is still choosing Harris.“I'm looking at Trump's plans, and I know it could get worse,” he said. “Trump is actively accepting contributions from people who want the full annexation of the West Bank. Trump, very importantly, has very specific plans for how he will criminalize our anti-war organizing here in this country. And that is a clear difference from Vice President Harris.”It’s a choice that has isolated him. Alawieh’s movement didn’t endorse Harris but still warned against voting for a third party and of what it sees as the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency.“I've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?” he said. “I have a hard time figuring out how to respond to that.”People here don’t use the word “war” to describe what’s happening in Gaza, where more than 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, aid has been intermittently blocked by Israel, hospitals bombed and people are trapped and unable to flee. They say genocide.It’s the subject of a case before the International Court of Justice and something Israel denies. Israel says it's going after Hamas which led the deadliest attack in that country’s history that killed some 1,200 people and saw fighters take some 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.The International Criminal Court's prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas officials over alleged war crimes.Now all those voters Alawieh helped mobilize just a few months ago are “being left on the table" by his party.And across the cafe, Samraa Luqman, a Yemeni American community organizer, is ready to pick those votes up for Trump.She said she met with former President Trump recently in Dearborn, where he made a promise to her to end the war. That stands in stark contrast to his public statements, in which he said Israel should “finish the job” and criticized Harris and Biden for calling for a cease-fire. At a rally for Trump just this weekend, speakers used racist and misogynistic rhetoric, including Rudy Giuliani. He demonized Palestinian toddlers, falsely claiming they are “taught to kill us at two years old.”Samraa Luqman, an activist and community organizer, at Haraz Coffee House in Dearborn on Oct. 1.Asked why, despite this rhetoric, she believes Trump’s promise to end the war, Luqman says he’s more likely to do so than Harris.“Believe him or not, if there is a 99% chance that Trump is going to continue the genocide and I have to weigh it against 100% chance that it's going to continue under Harris, I'm going to take the 99% chance,” she said. “The fact that there is that slight hope means that I need to go with the best thing for my people.”And she’s not the only one making this calculation. This weekend, several prominent Arab and Muslim leaders endorsed Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan.Luqman’s children are half-Palestinian, and this year of watching kids being killed is intolerable, she said. She blames the Biden administration and Harris directly for these deaths.“It hurts a lot. That hurt has transformed into rage,” she said. “I will do everything in my power to ensure Harris loses. Whatever I can do. And, I’m still a Democrat.”She sees this as a path to building real political power for a community that has over 200,000 votes in Michigan. For context, Trump won this state by about 11,000 votes in 2016 and Biden won by over 150,000 in 2020.Luqman wears a necklace featuring the Palestinian flag.“If Muslims are credited with swinging an election,” she said, “imagine the political strength we're going to have. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to be vying for our vote.”But most Arab American and Muslim Americans NPR interviewed around Dearborn said that if they don’t stay home on Election Day, they’ll go with a third-party choice: Jill Stein.The Green Party candidate has been actively campaigning in Michigan promising to “end the genocide.”She has no chance of winning, but she could pull a chunk of support from Harris, and the Harris campaign is running out of time to win these voters over.In the last few weeks, her campaign has made overtures. Last month, Harris met with some American Muslims and Arab Americans over an hour away in Flint. This weekend, a different group of Arab Americans endorsed Harris in Dearborn. They called her the strategic choice despite their disappointment. Trump, they said, has shown indifference to Palestinian suffering while promising mass deportations and the revival of a travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, known as the Muslim ban.The Harris campaign told NPR she is “committed to earn every vote” and that she has been steadfast in her support for American Muslims “including ensuring that they can live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration.”Some American Muslims view this as Harris making a real effort despite having to uphold Biden’s policies.Imam Mika'il Stewart Saadiq sits inside Kitab Cafe in Detroit on Oct. 10. He is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.“I’m not voting for Kamala because I’m afraid of Trump. I see her as a great candidate,” said Imam Mika’il Stewart Saadiq, a Black Muslim leader born and raised in Detroit.He is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.“I don't think it's fair that we lay the blame of the mess of eight years of older white men at the feet of a Black woman in our generation who's saying cease-fire now before the president said it,” he said in an interview. “We've seen what Trump can do. We've seen what Biden can do. Let's see what she can do.”Saadiq voted uncommitted in the primary, but once Harris got on the ticket he got behind her.“I respect people's righteous indignation and people saying I just can't vote. I'm never going to try and convince a Palestinian American that they should understand my political calculus,” he said. “But then when it comes to Trump and the MAGA beast at the gate, again we ask the question, OK, now are you asking me to sacrifice myself? Because remember, anti-Black racism, usually when you're darker, you get it the worst.”He shares a parable from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad to make his point. The story is about a boat with lower- and upper-deck passengers.“We're all in the same boat. We are Americans,” Saadiq said. “People at the bottom of the boat, they want water, so they're like, ‘Hey, we have an idea. We're going to bust a hole in the bottom of the boat and get water.’ If the people at the upper level don't stop them, then everybody sinks. So in this hysterical political climate, there are some of us that say, OK. Don't put the hole in the bottom of the boat. Don't sink everybody.”But with just days until the election and the war expanding, many Arab and Muslim American voters in this battleground state said they already feel like they’re sinking.This story was edited for digital by Majd Al-Waheidi.

CONTENT: We don’t know what we think we know about how Americans will vote.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Well, it’s that time again: Millions of Americans are stress-eating while clicking “Refresh” on 538’s presidential forecast, hoping beyond hope that the little red or blue line will have made a tiny tick upward. Some may be clutching themselves in the fetal position, chanting under their breath: “There’s a good new poll out of Pennsylvania.”The stakes of this election are sky-high, and its outcome is not knowable in advance—a combination that most of us find deeply discomfiting. People crave certainty, and there’s just one place to look for it: in the data. Earlier humans might have turned to oracles or soothsayers; we have Nate Silver. But the truth is that polling—and the models that rely primarily on polling to forecast the election result—cannot confidently predict what will happen on November 5.The widespread perception that polls and models are raw snapshots of public opinion is simply false. In fact, the data are significantly massaged based on possibly reasonable, but unavoidably idiosyncratic, judgments made by pollsters and forecasting sages, who interpret and adjust the numbers before presenting them to the public. They do this because random sampling has become very difficult in the digital age, for reasons I’ll get into; the numbers would not be representative without these corrections, but every one of them also introduces a margin for human error.Most citizens see only the end product: a preposterously precise statistic, such as the notion that Donald Trump has a 50.2 percent—not 50.3 percent, mind you—chance of winning the presidency. (Why stop there? Why not go to three decimal points?) Such numerical precision gives the false impression of certainty where there is none.Read: The world is falling apart. Blame the flukes.Early American political polls were unscientific but seemingly effective. In the early 20th century, The Literary Digest, a popular magazine in its day, sent sample ballots to millions of its readers. By this method, the magazine correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election from 1916 until 1936. In that year, for the contest between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Alf Landon, the Digest sent out roughly 10 million sample ballots and received an astonishing 2.4 million back (a response rate of 24 percent would be off the charts by modern standards). Based on those responses, the Digest predicted that FDR would receive a drubbing, winning just 41 percent of the vote. Instead, he won 61 percent, carrying all but two states. Readers lost faith in the Digest (it went out of business two years later).The conventional wisdom was that the poll failed because in addition to its readers, the Digest selected people from directories of automobile and telephone ownership, which skewed the sample toward the wealthy—particularly during the Great Depression, when cars and phones were luxuries. That is likely part of the explanation, but more recent analysis has pointed to a different problem: who responded to the poll and who didn’t. For whatever reason, Landon supporters were far more likely than FDR supporters to send back their sample ballots, making the poll not just useless, but wildly misleading. This high-profile error cleared the way for more “scientific” methods, such as those pioneered by George Gallup, among others.The basic logic of the new, more scientific method was straightforward: If you can generate a truly random sample from the broader population you are studying—in which every person has an equally likely chance of being included in the poll—then you can derive astonishingly accurate results from a reasonably small number of people. When those assumptions are correct and the poll is based on a truly random sample, pollsters need only about 1,000 people to produce a result with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.To produce reasonably unbiased samples, pollsters would randomly select people from the telephone book and call them. But this method became problematic when some people began making their phone numbers unlisted; these people shared certain demographic characteristics, so their absence skewed the samples. Then cellphones began to replace landlines, and more pollsters made use of “random-digit dialing,” which ensured that every active line had an equal chance of being called. For a while, that helped.But the matter of whom pollsters contacted was not the only difficulty. Another was how those people responded, and why. A distortion known as social-desirability bias is the tendency of respondents to lie to pollsters about their likely voting behavior. In America, that problem was particularly acute around race: If a campaign pitted a minority candidate against a white candidate, some white respondents might lie and say that they’d vote for the minority candidate to avoid being perceived as racist. This phenomenon, contested by some scholars, is known as the Bradley Effect, named after former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley—a Black politician who was widely tipped to become governor of California based on pre-election polling, but narrowly lost instead. To deal with the Bradley Effect, many pollsters switched from live callers to robocalls, hoping that voters would be more honest with a computer than another person.But representative sampling has continued to become more difficult. In an age of caller ID and smartphones, along with persistent junk and nuisance calls, few people answer when they see unfamiliar numbers. Most Americans spend much of their time online, but there are no reliable methods to get a truly random sample from the internet. (Consider, for example, how subscribers of The Atlantic differ from the overall American population, and it’s obvious why a digital poll on this site would be worthless at making predictions about the overall electorate.)These shifts in technology and social behavior have created an enormous problem known as nonresponse bias. Some pollsters release not just findings but total numbers of attempted contacts. Take, for example, this 2018 New York Times poll within Michigan’s Eighth Congressional District. The Times reports that it called 53,590 people in order to get 501 responses. That’s a response rate lower than 1 percent, meaning that the Times pollsters had to call roughly 107 people just to get one person to answer their questions. What are the odds that those rare few who answered the phone are an unskewed, representative sample of likely voters? Zilch. As I often ask my undergraduate students: How often do you answer when you see an unknown number? Now, how often do you think a lonely elderly person in rural America answers their landline? If there’s any systematic difference in behavior, that creates a potential polling bias.To cope, pollsters have adopted new methodologies. As the Pew Research Center notes, 61 percent of major national pollsters used different approaches in 2022 than they did in 2016. This means that when Americans talk about “the polls” being off in past years, we’re not comparing apples with apples. One new polling method is to send text messages with links to digital surveys. (Consider how often you’d click a link from an unknown number to understand just how problematic that method is.) Many pollsters rely on a mix of approaches. Some have started using online “opt-in” methods, in which respondents choose to take a survey and are typically paid a small amount for participating. This technique, too, has raised reasonable questions about accuracy: One of my colleagues at University College London, Thomas Gift, tested opt-in methods and found that nearly 82 percent of participants in his survey likely lied about themselves in order to qualify for the poll and get paid. Pew further found that online opt-in polls do a poor job of capturing the attitudes of young people and Hispanic Americans.No matter the method, a pure, random sample is now an unattainable ideal—even the aspiration is a relic of the past. To compensate, some pollsters try to design samples representative of known demographics. One common approach, stratification, is to divide the electorate into subgroups by gender, race, age, etc., and ensure that the sample includes enough of each “type” of voter. Another involves weighting some categories of respondents differently from others, to match presumptions about the broader electorate. For example, if a polling sample had 56 percent women, but the pollster believed that the eventual electorate would be 52 percent women, they might weigh male respondents slightly more heavily in the adjusted results.Read: The asterisk on Kamala Harris’s poll numbersThe problem, of course, is that nobody knows who will actually show up to vote on November 5. So these adjustments may be justified, but they are inherently subjective, introducing another possible source of human bias. If women come out to vote in historically high numbers in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, for example, the weighting could be badly off, causing a major polling error.The bottom line is that modern pollsters are trying to correct for known forms of possible bias in their samples by making subjective adjustments to the data. If their judgments are correct, then their polls might be accurate. But there’s no way to know beforehand whether their assumptions about, say, turnout by demographic group are wise or not.Forecasters then take that massaged polling data and feed it into a model that’s curated by a person—or team of people—who makes further subjective assessments. For example, the 538 model adjusts its forecasts based on polls plus what some in the field call “the fundamentals,” such as historical trends around convention polling bounces, or underlying economic data. Most forecasters also weight data based on how particular pollsters performed in earlier elections. Each adjustment is an educated guess based on past patterns. But nobody knows for sure whether past patterns are predictive of future results. Enough is extraordinary about this race to suspect that they may not be.More bad news: Modern polling often misses the mark even when trying to convey uncertainty, because pollsters grossly underestimate their margins of error. Most polls report a plus or minus margin of, say, 3 percent, with a 95 percent confidence interval. This means that if a poll reports that Trump has the support of 47 percent of the electorate, then the reported margin of error suggests that the “real” number likely lies between 44 percent (minus three) and 50 percent (plus three). If the confidence interval is correct, that spread of 44 to 50 should capture the actual result of the election about 95 percent of the time. But the reality is less reassuring.In a 2022 research paper titled “Election Polls Are 95 Percent Confident but Only 60 Percent Accurate,” Aditya Kotak and Don Moore of UC Berkeley analyzed 6,000 polls from 2008 through 2020. They found that even with just one week to go before Election Day, only about six in 10 polls captured the end result within their stated margin of error. Four in 10 times, the polling data fell outside that window. The authors conclude that to justify a 95 percent confidence interval, pollsters should “at least double” their reported margins of error—a move that would be statistically wise but render polling virtually meaningless in close elections. After all, if a margin of error doubled to six percentage points, then a poll finding that Harris had 50 percent support would indicate that the “true” number was somewhere between 44 percent (a Trump landslide) and 56 percent (a Harris landslide).Alas, the uncertainty doesn’t end there. Unlike many other forms of measurement, polls can change what they’re measuring. Sticking a thermometer outside doesn’t make the weather hotter or colder. But poll numbers can and do shift voting behavior. For example, studies have shown that perceived poll momentum can make people more likely to vote for the surging party or candidate in a “bandwagon” effect. Take the 2012 Republican primaries, when social conservatives sought an alternative to Mitt Romney and were split among candidates. A CNN poll conducted the night before the Iowa caucus showed Rick Santorum in third place. Santorum went on to win the caucus, likely because voters concluded from the poll that he was the most electable challenger.The truth is that even after election results are announced, we may not really know which forecasters were “correct.” Just as The Literary Digest accurately predicted the winner of presidential races with a deeply flawed methodology, sometimes a bad approach is just lucky, creating the illusion of accuracy. And neither polling nor electoral dynamics are stable over time. Polling methodology has shifted radically since 2008; voting patterns and demographics are ever-changing too. Heck, Barack Obama won Indiana in 2008; recent polls suggest that Harris is losing there by as much as 17 points. National turnout was 55 percent in 2016 and 63 percent in 2020. Polls are trying to hit a moving target with instruments that are themselves constantly changing. For all of these reasons, a pollster who was perfectly accurate in 2008 could be wildly off in 2024.In other words, presidential elections are rare, contingent, one-off events. Predicting their outcome does not yield enough comparable data points to support any pollster’s claim to exceptional foresight, rather than luck. Trying to evaluate whether a forecasting model is “good” just from judging its performance on the past four presidential elections is a bit like trying to figure out whether a coin is “fair” or “rigged” from just four coin flips. It’s impossible.Read: The man who’s sure that Harris will winThe social scientists Justin Grimmer, Dean Knox, and Sean Westwood recently published research supporting this conclusion. They write: “We demonstrate that scientists and voters are decades to millennia away from assessing whether probabilistic forecasting provides reliable insights into election outcomes.” (Their research has sparked fierce debate among scholars about the wisdom of using probabilistic forecasting to measure rare and idiosyncratic events such as presidential elections.)Probabilistic presidential forecasts are effectively unfalsifiable in close elections, meaning that they can’t be proved wrong. Nate Silver’s model in 2016 suggested that Hillary Clinton had a 71.4 percent chance of victory. That wasn’t necessarily “wrong” when she lost: After all, as Silver pointed out to the Harvard Gazette, events with a 28.6 percent probability routinely happen—more frequently than one in four times. So was his 2016 presidential model “wrong”? Or was it bang-on accurate, but an unusual, lower-probability event took place? There’s no way of knowing for sure.The pollsters and forecasters who are studying the 2024 election are not fools. They are skilled analysts attempting some nearly impossible wizardry by making subjective adjustments to control for possible bias while forecasting an uncertain future. Their data suggest that the race is a nail-biter—and that may well be the truth. But nobody—not you, not me, not the betting markets, not Nate Silver—knows what’s going to happen on November 5.More StoriesTrump Says Americans ‘Won’t Have to Vote Anymore’ If He WinsThe CrowdStrike Failure Was a Warning

n 2024, podcasts eclipsed traditional media outlets in their influence over the U.S. election as certain shows with massive audiences managed to score interviews with sought-after subjects trying to widen their reach.Just look at Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to talk to Alexander Cooper on Call Her Daddy, a popular podcast known mostly for raunchy sex jokes that crucially attracts young women. Or President-elect Donald Trump's bro-cast tour on shows like The Joe Rogan Experience that are wildly popular among young men.Read More: Call Her Daddy’s Alexandra Cooper Made Her Name Talking About Sex. Now She’s Pushing Beyond ThatSorry, but you won't find any of those shows on this best-of list. While some are enjoyable listens, those hosts by definition are not asking our world leaders the hardest questions: That's why many powerful people prefer to do interviews on those platforms rather than with traditional news outlets.Still, you will find some of podcasting's most famous faces—voices?—on this roundup. Call me nostalgic but I found myself seeking out old favorites this fall. Shows I had not listened to for years, like 99% Invisible and Modern Love, experimented with new topics and formats that drew me back into the fold. I eagerly tuned in to new shows from beloved podcasting veterans like Reply All's Alex Goldman, Missing Richard Simmons' Dan Taberski, or Still Processing's Wesley Morris. And the Lonely Island guys did the impossible: Recording a television recap podcast that's actually funny and worth your time.Here are the best podcasts of the year.As the name might suggest, this audio diary show isn't about becoming a girl boss or perfecting the high wire act of motherhood. In each episode, a different woman in a particularly fascinating circumstance records a day in her normal life. Some of the more enthralling stories include a recording from an 80-something pinup girl about her time shopping for vibrators and a telehealth abortion provider who works for the intentionally provocative Satanic Temple.The host-less format is a risk—the episodes don't have a particular unifying theme or message about womanhood. But we are safe in the hands of two podcasting veterans who know a little something about being a lady: Jane Marie investigated multilevel marketing schemes that target women in The Dream, and Joanna Solotaroff helped produce one of the first breakout comedy podcasts, 2 Dope Queens. The resulting show celebrates women—whatever their specific experiences may be.Start Here: Finally! A Show About an 83 Year Old Calendar GirlJon Ronson's podcast on the culture wars is back for a second season that is even better than the first. Ronson, who wrote Men Who Stare at Goats and So You've Been Publicly Shamed among other works, has spent much of the last couple decades chronicling the erosion of our shared notion of truth. Things Fell Apart tries to understand how this fracture occurred by exploring the unlikely origins of major cultural shifts.Each episode asks a question: How does a serial killer targeting Black sex workers in the 1980s connect to the killing of George Floyd in 2020? How does a bestselling book on trauma fuel campus protests? The stories themselves are engrossing. They take twists and turns that you won't expect. But the overall effect is chilling.Start Here: S2. Ep1: The Most Mysterious DeathsMidlife is often marked by crises, boredom, and restlessness. Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code and all-around high-achieving woman, feels ready to blow up her monotonous existence as she stares down 50. On this show, she invites on accomplished women to offer guidance on finding happiness at a challenging time when kids are leaving the home, careers stall, and the body begins to shift.Saujani takes a few cues from fellow Lemonada podcaster Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who attempts to extract wisdom on aging from women in their 70s and beyond in Wiser Than Me. This show is aimed at a younger demographic and Saujani brings an almost pleading vulnerability to the conversations: She seems to genuinely need guidance on how to endure. Her impressive array of early guests includes Louis-Dreyfus herself, famous economist and parenting guru Emily Oster, and none other than Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. They offer an array of useful life tips: always find a new way to challenge yourself at work, schedule sex with your partner, and take a 20-minute nap when you're overwhelmed—in the Safeway parking lot, if you have to.Start Here: It Could Be F*cking Great With Julia Louis-DreyfusThe preeminent podcast on design—from architecture to clothing to the staging of this year's Olympics—deserves recognition nearly every year. This year, they decided to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Robert Moses biography, The Power Broker, with a book club of sorts. Show host Roman Mars and Daily Show writer Elliott Kalan examine Robert Caro's deep dive into the man who had a greater impact on forming New York City than arguably anybody else in history, inviting guests like New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to talk about Moses' legacy.Under Moses' supervision, the city built 35 highways, 13 bridges, parks, playgrounds, housing projects, Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium, and the 1964 World's Fair. But the urban planner also bulldozed through entire neighborhoods to build his ideal city—and doomed New Yorkers to terrible traffic by refusing to expand certain roadways beyond a few lanes. The podcast provides the perfect excuse to finally dip into the 1,200-page tome.Start Here: The Power Broker #1: Robert CaroThe Modern Love Podcast, an adaptation of the beloved New York Times column, has cycled through many formats over the years. Authors have read their essays on love, and so have celebrities. Hosts have conducted conversations with the writers and with readers. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the column, the podcast is yet again trying something new. In a series of recent episodes, host Anna Martin has asked celebrities ranging from Penn Badgley to Samin Nosrat to read essays and then spoken with them about the essays' amorous themes.The format works well. It's rare to hear guarded people open up, but something about reading heart-wrenching piece of writing preps these celebrities for honesty. Several come ready to spill—no one more so than Andrew Garfield, a heart-on-his-sleeve actor whose viral episode brought many to tears. The following episode with Chicken Shop Date host Amelia Dimoldenberg is not quite as vulnerable but equally as intriguing (especially given Garfield and Dimoldenberg's recent flirtations). You could say I've rekindled my relationship with Modern Love.Start Here: Andrew Garfield Wants to Crack Open Your HeartChenjerai Kumanyika of Uncivil is back with a show that delves into the history and mythology of the NYPD. That story, inevitably, ties to the evolution of policing in America as a whole. The podcast begins with a disturbing video shot by the NYPD surveilling Kumanyika's father, a civil right activist. Rewatching the footage inspired Kumanyika to take on this project.Kumanyika demonstrates how the very foundation of the institution is built on uneven ground: During the Civil War, New York police officers earned payments by kidnapping free Black men and women in the city and shipping them South to be enslaved. He then follows the evolution of the NYPD and the many problematic structural decisions that eroded trust between the police and the people they are sworn to protect. Throughout eight episodes, Kumanyika interweaves personal narrative with rigorous research on the NYPD's history to make the compelling argument that New Yorkers' safety isn't actually the prime objective of the nation's largest police force.Start Here: They Keep People Safe | 1Reply All was one of the longest-running and most beloved podcasts in the tech space until it imploded in 2022. Since, the two former co-hosts have struck out on their own and, after some experimentation, landed on podcast concepts that are, frankly, extremely similar to Reply All. That's not a criticism—many people dearly miss the original show.PJ Vogt's excellent Search Engine, which answers a wide range of questions about everything from animals in zoos to fentanyl in drugs, has only gotten better since it made my Top 10 list last year. Now comes Alex Goldman's Hyperfixed, a help desk podcast that riffs on Reply All's "Super Tech Support" segment. Goldman bills himself as an“overconfident idiot” all too eager to help with random problems that unfold in unexpected ways. An episode on a New Yorker who needs Goldman's help getting her driver's license expands into an investigation into why driving in New York is awful. An entry on perfecting a baking recipe diverts into the confounding history of the U.S. refusing to implement the metric system and an interview with award-winning chef Nancy Silverton. Though Goldman has only produced two episodes so far, the series proved immediately addictive and charming. I'm betting I'll become a regular listener.Start Here: Eva Needs to MeasureAs a dedicated listener to both Do You Like Prince Movies? from Grantland and Still Processing from the New York Times, I would tune in to just about anything Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Wesley Morris creates. Morris formerly co-hosted those shows with other writers. The Wonder of Stevie is a different endeavor, an overview and deep analysis of the career of an iconic musician that Morris tackles solo, though he occasionally gets a helping hand from none other than former President Barack Obama. Morris interviews the likes of Questlove, Janelle Monae and Michelle Obama about Stevie Wonder's career. (The Obamas' Higher Ground helped produce the podcast.)The podcast begins in 1972. Over the next five years, Wonder produced five albums and won half a dozen Grammys, one of the most impressive runs in music history. Even if you don’t care about Wonder, you should care about what Morris cares about: He is always able to succinctly divine meaning from great art. And this podcast in particular is a joyful celebration. He also heroically moderates a conversation in the final episode between Barack Obama and Stevie Wonder himself.Start Here: Music of My Mind | 1972Typically, podcasts that involve celebrities recapping their own shows tend to be self-indulgent, un-analytical, and not particularly revealing. But I fell hard for The Lonely Island & Seth Meyers Podcast. Each episodes focuses on a different Lonely Island Saturday Night Live sketch. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer offer insight into the stressful yet hilarious process of writing joke songs about d—cks in boxes with Justin Timberlake and coming up with swear words for Natalie Portman to rap.It's a cliche to praise podcasts for effortless chemistry, but it should be no surprise that a trio that has worked together for decades on songs like "I'm on a Boat" and movies like Pop Star have it. (So does Meyers, who apparently is in a daily text exchange with Samberg about their Spelling Bee scores.) The podcast serves up unabashedly nostalgic content for those of us who came of age in the late 2000s, but it also lands at an existential moment for SNL on the eve of its 50th anniversary. Some 20 years ago, Lonely Island dragged SNL into the YouTube era and set trends that persist on TikTok today. Perhaps there are lessons to be gleaned from this throwback show for the future of comedy.Start Here: Lazy SundayThe most engrossing podcast Dan Taberski has produced since Missing Richard Simmons, Hysterical investigates a mysterious illness that spread among high school girls randomly exhibiting Tourette's-like symptoms about a decade ago in Le Roy, New York. The incident is believed to be the largest case of mass hysteria since the Salem Witch Trials. The show explores the origins of hysteria, other modern examples, and what patients do when confronted with the frustrating diagnosis that their symptoms are "all in their head."While the history of hysteria is intriguing, Hysterical is at its strongest when Taberski is speaking with the women who were once afflicted by what they argue was a mysterious—but very real—illness. The scandal occurred near Taberski's hometown in upstate New York, and he’s able to bring a local charm to his color commentary and interviews. He manages to make what might feel like a dour show on a serious topic feel light and brisk.Start Here: Outbreak | 1WRITE TO ELIANA DOCKTERMAN AT ELIANA.DOCKTERMAN@TIME.COM

CONTENT: P
resident-elect Donald Trump has already begun building out a team to serve in his second term. Trump’s new administration is expected to look different from his first—he said in an October interview that the “biggest mistake” of his first term was choosing “bad, disloyal people” to join his administration. Donald Trump Jr. said in mid-November, after several unconventional choices had already been made, that pushback from the Washington establishment simply reflects his father fulfilling a campaign promise to appoint “actual disruptors—that’s what the American people want.” Many of the roles will need to be confirmed by the Senate—though Trump has demanded that Republican leadership let him bypass the typical confirmation process.Here are the key appointments, nominations, and staffing decisions announced by Trump’s transition team, in a list that will continue to be updated.Trump has tapped Brooke Rollins, the cofounder and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, to head the Department of Agriculture. The Wall Street Journal reported that her nomination was unexpected, given other candidates had relatively deeper agricultural background, though Rollins has a degree in agricultural development. Rollins served during Trump’s first term as director of the Office of American Innovation and acting director of the Domestic Policy Council. “From her upbringing in the small and Agriculture-centered town of Glen Rose, Texas, to her years of leadership involvement with Future Farmers of America and 4H, to her generational Family Farming background, to guiding her four kids in their show cattle careers, Brooke has a practitioner’s experience, along with deep Policy credentials in both Nonprofit and Government leadership at the State and National levels,” Trump said in a statement announcing his pick.Trump has nominated former NFL player Scott Turner to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and address the country’s housing affordability crisis. Currently, Turner serves as chair of Center for Education Opportunity at the America First Policy Institute. During Trump’s first term, Turner served as executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, overseeing federal opportunity zones, which attempt to spur economic growth and job creation in low-income communities while providing tax benefits to investors. His work there “help[ed] to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities,” Trump said in a statement announcing Turner’s nomination.Trump has selected Dr. Marty Makary, a surgical oncologist at Johns Hopkins University, to serve as commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If confirmed by the Senate, he will work closely with Trump’s Health Secretary-designate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose nomination Makary recently voiced support for.In his statement on Makary’s nomination, Trump vowed that Kennedy Jr. and Makary would “properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning our Nation's food supply and drugs and biologics being given to our Nation's youth, so that we can finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary became an outspoken voice against vaccine mandates, calling them a “complete dismissal of natural immunity.”Trump has chosen physician, veteran, and former congressman Dave Weldon (R-Fla.) to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In his announcement of his pick, Trump emphasized Weldon’s work to ban patents on human embryos (used in stem cell research) in Congress, and wrote that Weldon has “American Family Values” and will prioritize “Transparency, Competence and High Standards” at the CDC. While in Congress, in 2007 Weldon introduced a bill that would move responsibility for vaccine safety research from the CDC to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. (CDC director will now require Senate confirmation after new legislation.)Read More: Who Decides Who Leads U.S. Health Agencies?Trump is bringing back Alex Wong, a former deputy special representative for North Korea and deputy assistant secretary for North Korea in the State Department’s bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs during Trump’s first term, to be part of his senior national security staff in his second term. In his announcement, Trump said that Wong helped negotiate his summit with North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and that Wong led the State Department’s implementation of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy.Read More: How Asia Is Bracing for Trump’s Second TermAnother White House alum returning for Trump’s second term is conservative media commentator Sebastian Gorka, whom the President-elect picked to be a deputy assistant and the senior director for counterterrorism. Born to Hungarian parents in the U.K., Gorka is a “tireless advocate for the America First Agenda and the MAGA Movement,” Trump said in his statement announcing Gorka’s position.Gorka served as a strategist in Trump’s first term, leaving the post in August 2017 following the arrival of then chief of staff John Kelly and the ouster of Steve Bannon, whom Gorka was closely aligned with. Gorka is known for his incendiary remarks against Islam and its followers, and he is reportedly “widely disdained” within his field, even among fellow conservatives. The Washington Post reported that Michael Anton, a former communications and national security official in Trump’s first administration, removed himself from contention for a deputy national security adviser role in the second term after learning he would have to work with Gorka.John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic, called Gorka a “con man” in an interview on CNN.Trump nominated physician and Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat to be the next Surgeon General, a key health information leader for the public and public health officers. Currently, Nesheiwat serves as one of the medical directors of CityMD, a network of urgent care centers in New York and New Jersey. Her sister, Julia Nesheiwat, served as homeland security advisor during Trump’s first term, and Julia’s husband, Mike Waltz, is a Republican congressman from Florida who has been tapped to serve as Trump’s national security advisor.“Dr. Nesheiwat is a fierce advocate and strong communicator for preventive medicine and public health,” Trump said in a statement. “She is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare, and believes in empowering individuals to take charge of their health to live longer, healthier lives.”Trump has tapped outgoing congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) to run the Labor Department. Chavez-DeRemer narrowly lost her re-election bid earlier this month. During her time in Congress she was one of only a few House Republicans to support the PRO Act, a major pro-union bill, and she also served on the Education and the Workforce Committee.Chavez-DeRemer has support from key labor unions and figures including Teamsters president and Trump supporter Sean O’Brien. The AFL-CIO, however, gave her a lifetime score of 10%, with regards to her support for pro-union legislation. Multiple business groups have signaled their opposition to Trump’s choice of DeRemer.“Lori’s strong support from both the Business and Labor communities will ensure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success - Making America Richer, Wealthier, Stronger and more Prosperous than ever before,” Trump said in a statement announcing DeRemer’s nomination.Trump announced that he will nominate Russell Vought, a contributor to the conservative presidential transition playbook Project 2025 that Trump distanced himself from during his campaign, to once again be the director of the Office of Management and Budget. “He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term,” Trump said in a statement, adding, “Russ knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government, and he will help us return Self Governance to the People. We will restore fiscal sanity to our Nation, and unleash the American People to new levels of Prosperity and Ingenuity.”\Trump has appointed hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to run the Treasury Department in his second-term administration. Bessent is the founder and CEO of hedge fund firm Key Square Group and previously supported Democrats before turning to support Republican candidates and eventually Trump, though he was not in Trump’s orbit during his first term. Bessent is known to support tariffs and has also backed extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He would also be the country’s first openly gay Treasury Secretary.“As a lifelong Champion of Main Street America and American Industry, Scott will support my Policies that will drive U.S. Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances, work to create an Economy that places Growth at the forefront, especially through our coming World Energy Dominance,” Trump wrote in a statement announcing Bessent’s nomination.Read More: Why CEOs Are Cheering Donald Trump’s Pick for Treasury SecretaryTrump has tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to run the Department of Justice, replacing his earlier nominee, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who withdrew from consideration after facing scrutiny over alleged sexual misconduct involving at least one minor.Bondi, a longtime Trump loyalist, served on the executive committee of his 2016 transition team, and during Trump’s first term, she was a member of Trump’s first-impeachment defense team. Since 2021, she has led the legal arm of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank formed to promote Trump’s agenda and plan for his second term.“For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,” Trump said in a statement announcing Bondi’s nomination. “Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again. I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!”Trump had previously nominated Gaetz for the role of U.S. Attorney General, prompting Gaetz to resign from Congress ahead of the release of an ethics probe that was then put on hold. (It’s not yet clear whether the committee’s report will be made public. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.) But the allegations followed Gaetz, who is deeply unpopular among many members of his own party, and in a post on X, he announced: “It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”In a post on Truth Social after Gaetz announced his withdrawal, Trump said he “greatly appreciate[s]” Gaetz’s efforts to get Senate approval but “has much respect” for his decision to step aside.Trump has nominated former congressman Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) to become the U.S. ambassador to Canada. Hoekstra served during Trump’s first term as the ambassador to the Netherlands and was a prominent campaign supporter as chair of the Michigan Republican Party. “In my Second Term, Pete will help me once again put AMERICA FIRST,” Trump said in a statement announcing his pick.Trump has named former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker to become the country’s ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In his statement announcing his pick, Trump said Whitaker is “a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended. Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.” Trump has shown dubious commitment to the military alliance, criticizing other members for not contributing as much as the U.S.Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa who was Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff until Trump fired Sessions and elevated Whitaker, has not previously served in a role focused on foreign policy. He is, however, a close ally of the President-elect, having vocally criticized special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and having come to Trump’s defense during his first impeachment proceedings, claiming: “Abuse of power is not a crime.”Trump has tapped his first-term Small Business Administration (SBA) administrator Linda McMahon to run the Department of Education during his second term. In a statement announcing his selection, Trump cited McMahon’s leadership credentials as a co-chair of his transition team alongside Commerce Secretary-designate Howard Lutnick and a chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute. McMahon, the former CEO and co-founder of WWE and a major Republican donor, has also served on the Connecticut Board of Education and on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, a state where she twice unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate.Trump promised during his campaign to dismantle the Department of Education. “We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES,” he said in his statement announcing McMahon’s nomination, “and Linda will spearhead that effort.”Trump has chosen celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department that provides health coverage to millions of Americans. In a statement announcing the pick, Trump said that Oz (known on TV as “Dr. Oz”) would work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist who has been nominated to run HHS, to “take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”“Our broken Healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country’s budget,” Trump said, adding that “Dr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention.” Oz would need to be confirmed by the Senate.As CMS Administrator, Oz would oversee programs including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance Marketplaces. During his unsuccessful run for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat two years ago, Oz pushed for “Medicare Advantage For All,” which would allow seniors to choose privately run health insurance plansEarly in the pandemic, Oz pushed unproven theories about COVID-19 cures, including the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as treatment, which caught Trump’s eye.Before entering politics, he was a heart surgeon and health expert on Oprah Winfrey’s show. Oz later appeared on his own show, known for providing medical tips and leaning into so-called alternative and complementary medicine. Oz is not the first television fixture to be selected for a key role in the Administration; Pete Hegseth (Defense secretary) is co-host of Fox & Friends. Trump announced that he has selected Howard Lutnick, the billionaire CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, to serve as his Secretary of Commerce. A vocal supporter of Trump’s economic policies, Lutnick has been an influential figure within the President-elect’s circle, advising on trade and economic matters throughout the transition process. He won the endorsement of Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla in Trump’s inner circle, for Treasury Secretary, but on Tuesday Trump tapped him for Commerce instead. In a statement, Trump praised Lutnick as a “dynamic force on Wall Street” and credited him with building a robust system to staff the incoming administration.If confirmed by the Senate, Lutnick, 63, would oversee an agency tasked with expanding U.S. economic growth, boosting domestic industries, regulating artificial intelligence, and managing the implementation of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which provides subsidies to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. It’s unclear whether the Trump Administration will proceed with disbursing the funds agreed to under current Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, as the Commerce Department has yet to release much of the allocated money despite having signed agreements with U.S. chipmakers. Lutnick would also inherit the Biden Administration’s broadband expansion initiative aimed at providing internet access to at least 6.25 million households by 2025.Given his extensive business holdings, Lutnick could face scrutiny over his finances and potential conflicts of interest during the confirmation process. In addition to being CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is chairman of BGC Group Inc, a brokerage company, and of Newmark Group, a commercial real estate company.Trump has tapped former congressman from Wisconsin and TV personality Sean Duffy to run the Transportation Department.Upon the announcement of his nomination Duffy, 53, parted ways with Fox, where he was a co-host of The Bottom Line on Fox Business and a contributor on Fox News. A former outdoor games athlete, Duffy has also worked as a commentator on ESPN and in the 1990s appeared on several MTV reality shows, where he met his wife. He then served for eight years as a prosecutor followed by eight years as a U.S. representative after his election in 2010 as part of the conservative populist Tea Party wave. Duffy left Congress in 2019 to focus on family health matters. Trump encouraged him to run for governor of Wisconsin in 2022, but he declined.If confirmed to the post, Duffy will succeed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg to head a department that oversees highways, railroads, aviation and other transportation systems, with a budget of about $110 billion. In his statement announcing the nomination, Trump said Duffy “will prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America’s highways, tunnels, bridges and airports. He will ensure our ports and dams serve our Economy without compromising our National Security, and he will make our skies safe again by eliminating DEI for pilots and air traffic controllers.”Trump announced that Brendan Carr will become chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the regulator of interstate and international communications. Since Carr is already on the commission, he can assume control when Trump takes office in January. Carr, whom Trump first nominated to the commission in 2017 and who has previously served as its general counsel, wrote the FCC chapter of the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025 presidential transition playbook. In it, he argued that the FCC should expand its oversight, aim to rein in Big Tech, ban TikTok in the U.S. on national security grounds, and roll back protections for tech companies under Section 230 of the Communications Act. “Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft & others have played central roles in the censorship cartel,” he posted on X last week. “The censorship cartel must be dismantled.”Carr is also publicly aligned with Elon Musk. He criticized the FCC’s refusal to finalize nearly $900 million in rural broadband subsidies for Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink, and his appointment could open up federal funding for it.“Commissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans’ Freedoms, and held back our Economy,” Trump said in a statement. “He will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America’s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.”Chris Wright, Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Energy, is the CEO of Denver-based fracking company Liberty Energy who has downplayed the effects of the climate crisis and is likely to be a vocal player in the administration against measures that aim to cut carbon emissions—if his appointment is confirmed by the Senate.In a LinkedIn video posted a year ago, Wright said: “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” In a May petroleum conference, Wright said that climate change “should be treated honestly and evaluated as trade-offs not as a religion or a cult, which unfortunately it's become.” In October, he acknowledged that climate change is a “real background phenomenon” that is “wildly misrepresented for political, media, all sorts of other reasons.”Wright, who has no prior political experience but was reportedly pushed for the role by Trump donor Harold Hamm, also sits on the Board of Directors for nuclear power start-up Oklo Inc. In the statement announcing Wright’s selection, Trump said Wright will also be a member of the new National Energy Council which will involve multiple departments and agencies and will focus on establishing “U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE.”Trump selected another of his personal legal defense team, William Owen Scharf, to join his administration. Scharf will take on the post of White House Staff Secretary and assistant to the President. Scharf represented Trump in his federal election interference case and his presidential immunity case, and he previously worked both in and out of the government during Trump’s first term on securing the confirmations of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Scharf, a former prosecutor, ran for Missouri Attorney General earlier this year but fell short in the GOP primary.Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, was named White House communications director, taking on a post that saw high turnover during the first Trump administration—with Trump having six during his first term. Cheung also worked on Trump’s first campaign and was director of strategic response during his first term. Prior to that, he worked as a spokesperson for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Sergio Gor, who co-founded a conservative publishing house with Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and ran a super PAC that spent tens of millions of dollars in support of Trump’s campaign, will lead the Presidential Personnel Office—which is responsible for helping to recruit, vet, and nominate some 4,000 political appointees throughout government.Trump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt will become the main liaison between members of the press and the incoming President. Leavitt, 27, will be the youngest-ever White House press secretary and the sixth woman in a row to hold the role. She was assistant press secretary during Trump’s first term. In 2022, she ran for Congress to represent a New Hampshire district but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.“Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Trump said in a statement. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.”Trump has tapped North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior in his upcoming Administration, elevating (if confirmed) a former Republican presidential primary rival turned staunch ally and even onetime running mate contender. The announcement was first made during an America First Policy Institute Gala at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on Nov. 14, following speculation about Burgum’s future role in the Administration. “He’s going to head the Department of Interior, and it’s going to be fantastic,” Trump said.The next day, Trump formally announced his selection in a statement, saying that Burgum will also head the new National Energy Council and have a seat on the National Security Council, a position not typically granted to the Interior Secretary. “Doug will be a key leader in ushering in a new ‘Golden Age of American Prosperity’ and World Peace,” Trump said.Burgum’s selection to head the Interior Department has raised eyebrows due to his lack of direct experience in environmental policy or natural resource management. However, his business background—he’s a former Microsoft executive—and ties to the energy sector could make him an attractive choice for an Administration eager to prioritize energy independence and deregulation. A former software entrepreneur, Burgum sold his tech company to Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion and spent several years as a senior vice president at the tech giant. His business acumen and relationships with key players in the energy industry have positioned him as a figure who could help advance Trump’s pro-energy, pro-business agenda. Burgum’s nomination would bring a decidedly corporate flair to the Department of the Interior, an agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and natural resources.Trump nominated Doug Collins, the former Republican congressman from Georgia, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a critical post tasked with overseeing the welfare of the nation’s more than 15 million veterans. Collins, a staunch Trump ally and former ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, has shown unwavering loyalty to Trump, particularly during the impeachment proceedings in the House and the fallout from the 2020 election. Collins was an Air Force Reserve chaplain who served in Iraq.Should he be confirmed in his new role, Collins will inherit a department grappling with both budget shortfalls and a controversial electronic health records overhaul that has been plagued by delays and safety concerns. The VA’s responsibility for providing care to veterans exposed to toxic substances, such as Agent Orange, was expanded by bipartisan legislation in 2022. In a statement on social media, Collins pledged to streamline operations, cut regulations, and address corruption within the department, promising to deliver “world class care” to veterans. “Together, we’ll make the VA work for those who fought for us,” he said.Trump has selected John Sauer, a key member of his legal defense team, to serve as the next U.S. Solicitor General. A former federal prosecutor and Missouri's Solicitor General from 2017 to 2023, is perhaps best known for his successful defense of Trump in a landmark Supreme Court case securing presidential immunity. The ruling, which found that a sitting President could not be prosecuted for official acts, was a critical victory for Trump amid ongoing legal challenges related to the 2020 election. Sauer had also urged the Supreme Court to intervene to keep Trump in power by challenging the 2020 election results in several crucial swing states.If confirmed as Solicitor General, Sauer will represent the federal government in key Supreme Court cases, including contentious matters involving transgender rights and gun control. “John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,” Trump said in a statement. The nomination reflects Trump’s deep reliance on his inner circle of legal allies, particularly those who have defended him against multiple investigations. Trump has picked his personal lawyer Todd Blanche to serve as deputy attorney general. The nomination is a significant move within Trump’s strategy of placing loyal allies in top Justice Department roles. Blanche, who spent years as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is credited with playing a pivotal role in defending Trump in several high-profile cases, including as the lead attorney in the New York hush-money trial that resulted in Trump’s conviction and in the cases related to his handling of classified documents and efforts to challenge the 2020 election results.In his new role, Blanche would oversee the daily operations of the Justice Department, manage its policy priorities, and help advise Attorney General Matt Gaetz if he’s confirmed by the Senate.Trump has selected Emil Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. A former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove worked alongside Blanche on Trump’s defense team in the Manhattan hush-money case and the federal investigations into mishandling classified documents and election subversion. Bove joins a growing group of Trump allies in key legal positions, reinforcing the President-elect’s strategy of relying on trusted figures in his upcoming Administration.“Emil is a tough and strong attorney, who will be a crucial part of the Justice Department, rooting out corruption and crime,” Trump said in a statement.Trump has selected Jay Clayton, the former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), an influential post known for its aggressive pursuit of high-profile financial and political corruption cases. If confirmed, Clayton, who has no criminal prosecution experience, would inherit a number of high-profile cases, including investigations into New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the prosecution of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat. Trump described Clayton as a “highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant,” pointing to his years of experience in the financial world, where he was known for his work in mergers and acquisitions before taking over at the SEC in 2017.Clayton’s tenure at the SEC was largely characterized by a pro-business approach, which included efforts to roll back certain regulations on Wall Street and to develop clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency investments. His leadership also saw significant enforcement actions, including a high-profile case against Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who will co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, for misleading statements about taking the company private. This will be Clayton's second attempt at taking the SDNY post, after a contentious attempt in 2020 to replace Geoffrey Berman, who held the position during part of Trump’s first term. At that time, his nomination faced resistance from both inside the Justice Department and from Democratic lawmakers who feared political interference, particularly because SDNY had been investigating Trump’s associates, including his former lawyers Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani. The SDNY has long been a thorn in the side of political figures, including Trump himself, who was investigated for his role in the 2016 hush-money payments, a case that led to his conviction in New York State court. During his campaign, Trump vowed to exact revenge against the officials who prosecuted him.Trump has picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The appointment comes less than three months after Kennedy dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Trump.Kennedy, 70, is known for his vocal opposition to vaccines, particularly his longstanding claims linking vaccinations to autism—a theory debunked by decades of scientific research. His views, which have earned him both fervent supporters and sharp critics, now position him at the helm of the very agency responsible for overseeing the nation’s health regulations.Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. The nomination marks a dramatic departure from conventional selections for the position, and it is likely to test the Senate's willingness to confirm yet another controversial figure. In his new role, Kennedy is expected to have significant influence over key health agencies within HHS, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). His past rhetoric, which includes calls for removing fluoride from drinking water and restructuring the National Institutes of Health (NIH), suggests that his tenure could lead to sweeping changes in federal health policy, especially around vaccine safety and food regulation. Kennedy has tempered some of his more extreme positions in recent interviews, such as assuring the public that he would not “take vaccines away from anybody,” but his broader agenda remains focused on revisiting vaccine safety studies and challenging longstanding health guidelines, particularly those related to childhood immunizations.Although Kennedy’s appointment has raised alarms among public health experts, Trump has expressed confidence in his new nominee’s ability to reshape the nation's health system. Trump said in a statement that Kennedy would “restore these agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research” and “end the Chronic Disease epidemic.”Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress, was selected by Trump to serve as Director of National Intelligence. The position will require Senate confirmation. Gabbard served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was a member of the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees. After running for President as a Democrat in 2019, she left the Democratic Party to become an independent. She joined the Republican Party in 2024 and endorsed Trump for President, co-chairing his transition team.Read More: ‘We Are Reeling’: Trump’s Pick of Tulsi Gabbard Alarms Intelligence CommunityFlorida Senator Marco Rubio has been named Secretary of State. Rubio currently serves as the vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and sits on the Foreign Relations Committee. He was a vocal critic of Trump in 2016 during his own presidential bid, but went on to endorse and campaign for him in 2024. Rubio has taken a hardline stance on China and Iran, and has called for an end of the war in Ukraine with a “negotiated settlement.” The role requires Senate confirmation.Longtime Trump advisor Stephen Miller was named deputy chief of staff for policy, which Trump’s Vice President-elect J.D. Vance had already confirmed in a post on X. The role does not require Senate confirmation.Miller worked with Trump on his 2016 campaign and then joined him in the White House as a senior adviser. He orchestrated some of the first Trump Administration’s controversial immigration policies, including the “zero tolerance” family separation policy. Upon leaving the White House, he started America First Legal, a conservative legal nonprofit, which targeted many Biden Administration initiatives.Dan Scavino, a key figure in Trump’s political orbit for nearly a decade, has been appointed as deputy chief of staff and assistant to the President. Scavino first worked for Trump as a caddy at one of his golf courses, and has risen through the ranks to become one of Trump’s most trusted and longest-serving aides. He played a central role in shaping Trump’s media presence, first as social media director for the 2016 campaign and later as the White House’s director of social media during Trump’s first term. In his new role, Scavino will likely continue to wield significant influence over both the day-to-day operations of the White House and Trump’s public messaging strategy.In 2022, he was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House committee investigating the January 6th Capitol insurrection, though the Department of Justice declined to prosecute him.James Blair has been appointed as deputy chief of staff for legislative, political, and public affairs, a role that will place him at the heart of Trump’s political strategy and legislative agenda. Blair previously served as political director for both Trump’s 2024 campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC), and was also a top aide for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He played a pivotal role in crafting Trump’s economic messaging during his campaign, including the "Trump can fix it" slogan. Blair will also serve as an assistant to the President.Taylor Budowich has been appointed as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, placing him at the forefront of Trump’s public relations and staffing strategies. A veteran of Trump’s political operations, Budowich launched and directed Make America Great Again, Inc., the pro-Trump Super PAC that supported his 2024 bid. He also served as the spokesperson for Trump after his first term, working closely with the Save America PAC to shape the narrative surrounding Trump’s post-White House political activities.The governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem, will be the next Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The agency oversees everything from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Secret Service.“She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries,” Trump said in a statement sharing the pick.A Trump loyalist, Noem was an outspoken opponent of COVID-19 safety measures and has historically taken a hardline stance on immigration. She was expected to be a front-runner for Trump’s Vice President pick in 2024, but faced controversy for admitting in her book, No Going Back, that she killed her 14-month-old dog after it ruined a hunt, killed another family’s chickens, and moved to bite her.Trump announced that his prominent supporter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE, for short). In a statement, Trump shared that the two will work from outside the government but partner with the White House and Office of Management and Budget to “drive large scale structural reform and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.” Trump said that the two will finish their work by July 4, 2026.Ramaswamy, who ran in the Republican primary before dropping out and endorsing Trump, made reducing government spending a key part of his campaign. During his campaign, Trump also mentioned the possibility of giving Musk, who has said he could cut nearly a third of annual government spending, a role in the Administration.As co-host of Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends, Pete Hegseth is an untraditional choice for Secretary of Defense. “I am honored to announce that I have nominated Pete Hegseth to serve in my Cabinet as The Secretary of Defense,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First.” If confirmed, Hegseth, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and at Guantanamo Bay, will take on the job amidst a number of global crises—including the Israel-Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia conflict.Trump said he will name John Ratcliffe to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), pending confirmation by the Senate. Ratcliffe served as a Texas congressman from 2015 to 2020, before joining the first Trump Administration as Director of National Intelligence. While in Congress, he served as a member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees and as Cybersecurity Chairman on the Homeland Security Committee. Ratcliffe, who received a National Security Medal from Trump in 2020, testified in front of a grand jury as part of a criminal probe into the aftermath of the 2020 election, and warned White House staffers against following through with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to a former White House staffer.William Joseph McGinley, who served as White House Cabinet secretary in the first Trump Administration, will serve as Trump’s White House counsel. McGinley most recently worked as an outside counsel for the Republican National Committee’s election integrity team during the 2024 election.“Bill is a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement,” Trump said in a statement announcing the decision.Trump has appointed real estate executive and philanthropist Steven Witkoff as his special envoy to the Middle East, tapping a close personal ally and major campaign fundraiser for a role that could shape U.S. foreign policy in the region. Witkoff, the chairman and CEO of Witkoff Group, played a key role in rallying financial backing for Trump from Jewish donors, particularly during tensions with the Biden Administration over military support for Israel.Trump praised Witkoff’s business acumen and philanthropic efforts, calling him an “unrelenting Voice for PEACE,” while noting his ability to make “every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous.” Witkoff was golfing with Trump at Trump’s club in West Palm Beach, Florida in September when the former President was the target of a second assassination attempt.The special envoy role remains somewhat undefined compared to traditional diplomatic positions. Witkoff has no prior experience in foreign diplomacy. He has been an outspoken advocate for Trump’s Middle East policies, praising the former President for his efforts to strengthen Israel's position and curb Iran’s influence. Witkoff is also set to co-chair Trump’s inaugural committee.Trump has selected former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel, tapping a loyal ally for the high-profile diplomatic position with the region in crisis. If confirmed by the Senate, Huckabee will step into the role as Israel wages a multifront war against Iran’s proxies and a humanitarian catastrophe unfolds in Gaza.A staunch defender of Israel and a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Huckabee has long been a proponent of U.S. policies that align with Israeli interests, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy to the city. His appointment signals a continuation of Trump’s support for Israel, particularly in its conflict with Hamas and its broader territorial claims.“Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,” Trump said in a statement. “He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!”An evangelical Christian, Huckabee would be the first non-Jewish person to hold the role since 2011. Huckabee has consistently dismissed the notion of Palestinian statehood within Israeli borders, suggesting in the past that any Palestinian state should be established in neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan. During his 2008 presidential campaign, he said, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.” He has also signaled that he opposes negotiating a ceasefire deal with Hamas, calling on the Islamist militant group to surrender.Huckabee’s daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the current Governor of Arkansas and served as White House press secretary during Trump’s first term.Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman from Florida, was tapped to serve as Trump’s national security advisor. Waltz, a Green Beret veteran who served in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa, has been a member of Congress since 2019. He is a member of the House’s China Task Force, along with the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees. Waltz, widely known for his aggressive stance on China and Iran, will step into the role amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Last year, he wrote an op-ed for Fox News in which he argued that “the era of Ukraine’s blank check from Congress is over.” He, like Trump, has also called for European countries to contribute more to NATO. The role does not require Senate confirmation.“Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength,” Trump said in a statement.Trump nominated New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik has been a critic of the U.N., in particular over the organization’s stance on Israel, saying last month that the Biden Administration should consider a “complete reassessment” of U.S. funding of the U.N. given the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to expel Israel from the General Assembly. Stefanik has been a vocal supporter of Trump, during both of his impeachment trials and as he contested the results of the 2020 election. She has ascended the party’s ranks, serving as chair of the House Republican Conference, the fourth highest position in House GOP leadership. Stefanik’s appointment will need to be confirmed by the Senate.Trump has picked Lee Zeldin, a former New York representative, to serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The position is subject to Senate confirmation. Zeldin said he would “restore U.S. energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,” while committing to clean air and water, in a statement posted on X.Zeldin represented a district spanning from Long Island to the Hamptons while in Congress from 2015-2023 and previously served as a major in the Army Reserve. Zeldin was a staunch defender of Trump during his first term and sided with him during both impeachments. Zeldin most recently ran against New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in the state’s 2022 gubernatorial race.Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was appointed as “border czar,” a role that will likely be involved in Trump’s plan for mass deportations of millions of undocumented migrants. Homan, a former police officer, will be in charge of the southern and northern U.S. borders, as well as “all Maritime and Aviation Security,” according to Trump’s post on Truth Social. Homan also served in Trump’s first term—acting as ICE director from January 2017 to June 2018—and played a role in Trump’s crackdown on immigration, as one of the architects of the administration’s controversial child separation policy. The role will not require Senate confirmation.Susie Wiles, Trump’s 2024 campaign manager, was named White House chief of staff soon after Election Day, in the first major staffing decision. A longtime Republican strategist and campaign staffer, Wiles worked on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign and managed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ winning gubernatorial campaign in 2018. Wiles, who Trump referred to as the “ice maiden” in his election night victory speech, will be the first woman to serve as chief of staff.—With additional reporting by Solcyré Burga and Rebecca Schneid.WRITE TO SIMMONE SHAH AT SIMMONE.SHAH@TIME.COM AND NIK POPLI AT NIK.POPLI@TIME.COM

CONTENT: Donald Trump has lost all discipline. Will that affect the outcome of the election?Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsOne thing tomorrow’s election will test is Americans’ appetite for chaos, particularly the kind that Donald Trump has been exhibiting in the last few months of his campaign. After weeks of running a disciplined campaign, Trump’s advisers lost control of their candidate, the Atlantic staff writer Tim Alberta reported this week. Trump grew restless and bored and drifted off script in his campaign appearances. During a summer interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, for example, he mused aloud about Kamala Harris, “I don’t know. Is she Indian or is she Black?” From the perspective of his advisers, Trump’s string of offensive public statements needlessly alienated potential voters. Members of Trump’s campaign staff told Alberta that they became disillusioned about their ability to rein in their candidate and left the campaign.Will this unleashed version of Trump affect the election outcome? In this week’s episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Alberta and another Atlantic staff writer, Mark Leibovich, about how candidate Trump transformed over the summer, how Kamala Harris’s campaign reacted, where each campaign stands now, and what it means for the election. Alberta and Leibovich also offer tips on how to manage your inner chaos while watching the election results.The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is a bonus episode of Radio Atlantic. We are recording the Monday before Election Day. The candidates are furiously campaigning in the swing states. At some point, their planes were on the same tarmac in North Carolina.Over the weekend, Donald Trump mused about shooting reporters; Kamala Harris said normal campaign things. And yet the race is still one of the closest in American history.Anyway, in this episode, I want to get the inside view of both political campaigns in their last days. So I have with me today two seasoned political reporters, Mark Leibovich. Hi, Mark.Mark Leibovich: Hi, Hanna.Rosin: And Tim Alberta. Hi, Tim.Tim Alberta: Hi, Hanna. Hi, Mark.Leibovich: Hi, Tim. Isn’t it good to be seasoned today?Alberta: I’m feeling very seasoned.Rosin: Yeah, that’s a cliché word. It doesn’t mean old. What’s a more flattering word than seasoned? Like, experienced? Or longtime? Longtime: that’s flattering, I think.Leibovich: It’s definitely flattering.Alberta: We don’t use veteran.Rosin: No, veteran is old. How about active?Leibovich: Yeah, we’re very active. Yeah. Can you tell by our voices?Rosin: (Laughs.) Anyway, Mark, I understand you’re writing up a preelection guide to how to approach Tuesday night.Leibovich: Basically, I’m trying to collect a helpful toolkit to how to approach Election Day from sort of a practical standpoint as far as what information you can ignore, but also a habit or even mindfulness standpoint about how to not drive yourself needlessly crazy, how not to be triggered by the kinds of things that Election Night coverage will probably overload you with.And that includes Donald Trump probably declaring victory wildly prematurely or erroneously, which, I mean, will be news because he’s one of the candidates, but it also should surprise no one. And there are ways to kind of condition yourself, or try to, going into what tomorrow night will be like—which will be obviously very anxious for a lot of people.Rosin: I see. So instead of “We know it’s going to be like that,” like, “We know that we don’t have enough information.”We know that there probably isn’t going to be, sort of, instant early clarity. So you’re going into it eyes wide open, doing what? Like, what? Because maybe Tim needs this advice.Leibovich: Well, I’m trying. Well, I think we all need this advice, Hanna. I mean, I think it’s an approach to how we consume information, how we get information.I talked to a couple of Democratic consultants who said that one of the first things they do is turn off all their text notifications, because any kind of text notification is designed to trigger you on Election Night.There is a lot of manipulation of your emotions before the actual only information that is necessary, which, the most valuable information is going to come in probably after 11 o’clock, or quite late. It could be days later. The idea is the news will find you. Turn off your phone if you can. Information is coming in haphazardly from a million different directions, out of order, in no particular sequence whatsoever, about something that has already happened—meaning the voting has already happened. So no control is there. This is basically just people throwing information out in no order, and it is not necessarily—Rosin: It’s not cumulative and it’s not adding up to—Leibovich: —Not cumulative.Rosin: Exactly. Exactly.Leibovich: So anyway, that’s one reason you can skip that part.Rosin: Interesting. Tim, do you think you could do that?Alberta: I fear that in the attempt to not drive myself crazy, I would drive myself crazy. In other words, you would find your brain stacking up with all of the things that other people know that you don’t, because in that moment you have decided to sequester yourself or at least to sort of rigidly compartmentalize your emotions and your brain waves and your political intake.And therefore the exit polling showing the number of non-college whites in Maricopa County breaking away from Trump is lost on you in that pivotal moment, when that could be the little parcel of information that is necessary for you to believe that you have finally figured out this electoral equation and that you have a bead on it in this moment.It’s a game of inches, and the inches are everywhere around us, Hanna. So how could I give up any of those inches when we are so close to the end of the game? I want the zen that Mark is offering, but I just don’t find it realistic.Rosin: Hmm. You know how sometimes you start with the moment of meditation? We’ll consider that our moment of meditation, and now we’re gonna go into the stressful part of this conversation. So, Tim, you’ve been covering the Republican side closely, and you recently spent a lot of time talking to Trump’s advisers.How would you describe the state of the campaign in the weeks before the election?Alberta: I would describe it as something slightly removed from the serenity that Mark has described for us.Rosin: Yes. Okay. Yeah.Alberta: Yeah, look, Hanna, I think the context here is really important: that this Trump campaign, unlike the previous two, was for the majority of its time in operation, really pretty disciplined, pretty smart.The people running the campaign had done a pretty good job of keeping Trump out of his own way and talking him out of bad ideas and sort of curbing some of his most self-destructive impulses. And what we’ve seen in the last couple of months is basically Trump going full Trump, and an inability among those senior advisers to really do anything to stop it.This has been kind of the proverbial slow-motion car wreck. And, you know, it’s not just Trump himself, although of course he is the inspiration for the chaos. He is the generator of all of the turmoil that you see.He is at the center of this chaos, but the chaos ripples out away from him. And so when you ask yourself the question of how could it be that at the most important public event of the campaign, with 20,000-plus jammed into Madison Square Garden in prime time, the whole world watching, and you pay a million dollars to put on this event, and the guy who kicks it off is a vulgar, shock jock, insult-roast comedian who was dropped by his own talent agency for using racial slurs onstage—how could this person possibly be booked into that position to open for Trump in that environment? It’s exactly the sort of thing that the people around him had been really successful in avoiding for most of the campaign. But ultimately, in the key home stretch here, in the sort of the witching hours of this campaign, it’s all fallen apart.Rosin: Mark, same for the Democrats. How would you describe where they are?Leibovich: I would say I’ve talked to a fair number of Democrats on the campaign in the last few days.It feels like something approaching the general area of the ballpark of confidence.Rosin: Interesting! Anomalous for Democrats.Leibovich: Well, they are so incredibly quick to embrace bad news and to go right from bad news to deep levels of doomsaying. I’ve not seen that in the last few days.I mean, look, I think their numbers internally seem a little better. I think a lot of the external polls have been encouraging. And I think you can’t underestimate how much of a train wreck Trump’s last 10 days have been, in a way that, if he loses, I think people will very much point to.Rosin: So, Mark, I remember we sat here in the spring and discussed how absolutely stagnant this race would be. Like, we were just sleepwalking into a repeat.Leibovich: But it was a great podcast. Everyone should listen to it again. (Laughs.)Rosin: But it was very, you know—we didn’t have much to say. And then for everybody, the reset button got pressed in July.Tim, the full Trump who we’ve seen on the campaign trail for the last few months started, actually, according to your account, before Harris entered the race. So what happened?Alberta: I think that maybe the proper visual here, Hanna, is like the wild animal that has chased down its prey and has mauled it mostly to death and is now just sort of pawing at it, toying with it, unsure of really what to do because, well, what’s left to do?Donald Trump really found himself, according to all the reporting I did, sort of over it. Sort of bored with running against Joe Biden. Because here is, in his view, this sort of hapless old man who can’t even string together sentences, much less really defend himself or go on offense in a meaningful way against Trump. And so I think that he’s looking at Joe Biden thinking, Gosh this is sort of a bore, and around this time, of course, in late June, early July, Trump’s polling is better than it’s ever been in any of his three campaigns for the presidency.The battleground polling is showing him consistently pulling ahead five, six, seven points across all of these states. The national polling is up. His favorability is up. Democrats are preparing for a bloodbath not just to lose the presidency but to lose the House and the Senate, and it’s, you know, The sky is falling. And everyone around Trump is sort of giddy and gleeful. They’re looking around like, Nothing can stop us.And around this time is when you started to see Trump talking a little bit differently, behaving a little bit differently, according to people close to him—almost looking for some disorder and some mayhem to inject into the campaign. He starts talking to people on the outside. And when Kamala Harris gets in the race, he was angry, on the one hand, because he thought he had it sort of sewn up against Biden, and he liked running against Biden in the sense that Biden really, you know, couldn’t punch back.But I think also he’s sort of excited in the sense that with Harris, he’s got this live target. He’s able to channel some of the base instincts that brought him to power in the first place. You know, Trump, I think, viewed the Harris switcheroo as a new lease on life in the sense that he was going to be able to go whole hog again.But the people around him were saying, No, no, no, no. That’s exactly what we don’t want you to do. And frankly, the reason you’re in this position is because you’ve listened to us and because you haven’t been going rogue and running the kind of, you know, totally undisciplined #YOLO 2016 campaign that you would like to run and that you would run if you were left to your own devices. And around that time is when Trump started to lose confidence in those people who were giving him that advice, and he brought in other people to help with the campaign, and from there things really started to spiral.Rosin: So, Mark, how are Democrats responding as Trump is reasserting this peak-Trump version of himself?Leibovich: I think in a kind of measured way. I mean, I think, look, the peak Trump pretty much speaks for itself. It’s not like you need people to amplify. I mean, to some degree you do, because outlets that a lot of Republicans watch—like, say, Fox—are going to be insulated from a lot of this, because just Fox doesn’t show it.I mean, that’s just not their point of emphasis, But I think they’ve been very deft—they’ve made a lot of ads around the kind of changing abortion messaging. I mean, even Melania Trump saying that she believes in a woman’s right to choose, things like that, to some degree, they’re trying to highlight it, but to another degree—this is a big political-operative cliché, but they are running their race.And I think the Democrats, beginning when Biden stepped aside, I think Harris has performed much better than a lot of people thought she would, and I think her campaign has made a lot of good decisions, and she herself has made a lot of good decisions.Rosin: It does, from the outside, seem exactly the opposite of the chaos inside the Trump campaign that Tim described, because if you think back to when Biden dropped out, there was some worry that the transition might not be smooth.Leibovich: Oh, 100 percent. I mean, Tim and I, remember, we were at the Republican convention together, and that was such a moment, because Trump was really kind of at his peak then, which is kind of ironic to say, because the assassination attempt had taken place two days before the convention started. But his popularity, I mean—there was a sense of confidence at that convention which was just off the charts to a degree to which you could almost sense the boredom creeping into Trump when he’s giving this acceptance speech, and I guess it was Thursday night, and then about halfway through, he just kind of went off the rails, and he just sort of—it became just a very unhinged acceptance speech, went from kind of a gripping one where he’s describing the assassination attempt to something completely different, which kind of became a metaphor for how the rest of the campaign would unfurl for him.And of course, three days later, Biden got out and then the world changed again.Rosin: All right, up next, I ask Tim and Mark whether the chaotic final months of the Trump campaign could end up costing him the election. That’s after the break.[Break]Rosin: So from a campaign manager’s perspective, the chaos is disturbing, but what we actually care about is whether it has any impact on voting day. Tim, so what are the ways the drama you describe could affect the election? Like, say, turnout or whatever it is that we’re worried about?Alberta: Well, look, if these episodes were contained to just Trump being a little bit goofy or going off message and sort of ranting and raving about the latest person who said something very nasty about him on cable news, I don’t think it would have much real-world effect. But I think that some of what we’re unpacking here over these past 10, 11, 12 weeks, Hanna, is something that actually gets to a fundamental weakness, which is a failure of the Trump team to expand its coalition.Or at the very least what we’re seeing is the way in which the potential of expanding the Trump coalition has been undermined by Trump’s own actions or by the people close to him. So, for example, we know based on six months of really solid, consistent data that Trump is likely to perform better with Latino voters as a whole and particularly with Latino men under 40 than any Republican nominee in modern history.And yet, when the dominant headline coming out of your rally at Madison Square Garden the week before the election is that one of your speakers calls the island of Puerto Rico floating trash in the ocean, this is self-sabotage.Another core component of this Trump campaign, from the beginning, has been How do we keep our margins tight in the suburbs outside of Detroit and Milwaukee and Philly and Vegas and elsewhere? How do we keep our margins tight with these college-educated, suburban women? We’re not going to win them, right? But how do we manage to keep it close? How do we lose them by just seven or eight points instead of by 16, 17, 18, 20 points?And when you look at, for example, the selection of J. D. Vance and, you know, his old, greatest-hits reel around childless cat ladies, and he thinks abortion should be illegal nationwide, right?And there’s just something that sort of went fundamentally awry over the summer. I think Mark is right. Both of us were remarking at the convention about how it was effectively an early Election Night victory party. I mean, they weren’t even—Republicans in Milwaukee weren’t even talking about the campaign as if it were going to be competitive. It was already over. The fat lady was singing onstage in prime time in Milwaukee. And yet, I remember corresponding with several smart Republicans—Trump supporters—while I was there, and they were a little bit nervous about the Vance selection. And then on Thursday night, to Mark’s point, Trump gives this sort of weird, meandering speech that seems to squander a lot of the goodwill that he had coming into that event because of the assassination attempt. And it felt like between those two things—the Vance selection and then the speech—and then, you know, 24 hours after leaving Milwaukee, Biden gets out, Harris takes over the ticket, and suddenly, those dominoes started to fall.And what we saw was all of the best-laid plans of the Trump operation go awry. And it wasn’t just surface-level things where we say, Oh, that was sort of silly he said that. Or Oh, this was an unforced error, but it’ll be a quick news cycle and blow over. Some of what we’ve seen, I think, will have a real impact at the ballot box.Rosin: So what you’re describing is a campaign strategy that is fairly traditional that they were following fairly successfully, which is: try and win over, you know, some middle-of-the-road voters, or at least not massively alienate those people.But, Trump has been running a very different kind of campaign—like going to Madison Square Garden—and fewer on-the-ground resources. And that seems like a pattern across swing states, which for me raises the question whether what these managers are calling chaos, like, that is the strategy.The strategy was always just: get a lot of attention.Alberta: I think it depends on the type of attention you’re talking about. So when Trump goes to the southern border and has, you know, hundreds of cameras following him around there and talks about the lives lost at the hands of illegal immigrants committing crimes—you know, that is attention, and it can even be attention that is rooted in some hyperbole, some demagoguing, some bombast. And yet it is productive attention politically for the Trump people, right? They look at this sort of cost-benefit analysis and they recognize that, sure, we might antagonize some people with this rhetoric. We might alienate some people with our focus on these issues, but we think that the reward is far greater than the risk.So there is, I think, plenty of good attention that the Trump people do want. I think what they’ve tried to avoid is a lot of the sideshow that is appealing to some of the very online, right-wing, MAGA troll base but does nothing to add to the coalition that I was describing a minute ago. And ultimately at the end of the day, politics is a math equation. It’s multiplication and addition.Leibovich: Right, and I think, to Tim’s point, immigration was an incredibly effective issue for Trump. When you tip that into people eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, and just how that took over the narrative of the Trump campaign—I mean, one, they look like fools; two, it insults the intelligence of so many people, and it turns a very serious and effective issue for the Trump campaign, immigration, into a joke and into just something really, really problematic and gross.Rosin: So the art of running a Trump campaign, then, is to siphon and manage and titrate the chaos exactly right. Like, you want the right kind of chaos, the right kind of attention, but if you lose control of it, it just comes back to bite you. Is that basically what’s happened?Alberta: Yeah, and it’s always gonna be a high-wire act, right? These people aren’t stupid. They knew what they were getting themselves into. In fact, Chris LaCivita—who is one of the two people managing the Trump presidential campaign here in 2024—within a few weeks of his decision to join the operation back in the fall of 2022, you have Trump saying that he wants to terminate parts of the Constitution. You have Trump saying and doing these sort of crazy, self-destructive things. And LaCivita is sort of looking around saying, What have I gotten myself into?And of course people who are friends with him are saying, Come on, dude, you knew exactly what you were signing up for. You know exactly what you were getting yourself into. So I think whatever degree of self-delusion may exist at the outset, when some of these folks ally themselves with Donald Trump, you know, it dissolves pretty quickly and they become clear-eyed about who they’re working for and what the challenges are.And to your point, Hanna, yes, there’s inevitably going to be some chaos, some attention-seeking behavior, some stuff that is vulgar and inappropriate and racist and misogynistic and whatever else. Their job is to try to turn things that are kind of potentially toxic into productivity. They’re trying to mine coals out of manure here, and again, I can’t stress this enough: For most of the campaign, they were actually doing a pretty good job of it. But at a certain point I think it just becomes too much to manage.Rosin: Mark, do you get the sense that the Harris campaign’s—you described it as, like, a little dose of confidence. Is that because of everything that Tim has described?Leibovich: Yeah. I mean, I think Trump has given them so much to work with. And not just like, Oh, look, he said this and sort of putting that out there. I mean, early indications about the revulsion that women are having—women voters are having for Trump—even more so than usual. And the degree to which they seem to be voting and maybe even lying to their husbands about—to kind of use a new ad that the Harris campaign is using which is basically saying, you know, a lot of Republican women are secretly going into the ballot, and behind their husband’s back, they’re voting for Kamala Harris. So again, Trump made their job easier, but I think they have taken what has been given to them. And I do feel hopeful. Yeah. Again, from talking to a bunch of them, and levels of very, very cautious optimism—which I would say, you know, it would probably be an absolute verboten thing for anyone anywhere near the Harris campaign to show anything more than just a tiny bit of confidence. Because that’s going to harken back to the overconfidence of 2016 or the overconfidence of 2020, you know—Biden was supposed to win by a lot more than he did.And I think what freaks everyone out is the idea that Trump, in the two times he’s been on a general-election ballot, has massively overperformed his polls. And now there’s a sense that perhaps that’s been accounted for in these polls and they’re undercounting African American voters, women voters, and so forth.So anyway, I think all of that is kind of baked into this, but look, I don’t want to suggest that anything other than massive anxiety is the default for everyone around this campaign. And I assume both campaigns.Rosin: Yeah. Okay. Let’s leave the listeners with thoughts about Election Night. There’s the zen option, and hopefully many of our listeners will take advantage of the zen option.Take a long, 12-hour walk. Be home by 11 p.m. and then turn on the television. Short of that, the map is really wide and open. I mean, seven open states. It’s a lot. So for those who are not spiritually built for the zen option, how—literally—will you guys be watching? Like, give a listener a guide of what to watch out for on the night.Leibovich: Well, yes, there are seven battleground states. But I think there’s a lot you can learn if you can get information from other states. You know, there’s a poll that everyone has been talking about—a lot of insiders have been talking about over the last few days—from Iowa. Iowa, no one considered a swing state. Safely red, certainly has been in the last few elections, certainly for Trump. Ann Selzer, a deeply respected pollster, came up with this Des Moines Register poll on Saturday night, having Harris ahead by three.Now, putting aside whether Iowa’s now a battleground state—I mean, if it’s even in the ballpark of accurate, I mean, as a euphoric result for people on Team Harris. I mean, look, if there are some early numbers from, say, South Carolina, Florida, that, you know, maybe show Trump’s margins a little lower than you would expect, possibly that’s something that you can learn from.So again, it’s not just the seven battlegrounds, which will probably take a while to count, especially in some of the states with laws that make it harder to count early votes. But, yeah, I mean, like, the whole country does vote. It’s like, margins do matter, and I think we can learn from a lot of people.And look, even, like, Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky—I mean there are these early states that you know exactly who is going to win, but you can learn from.Rosin: Because if the margins are smaller than they are expected to be, then that’s a bit of data that’s interesting. Tim, what about you?Alberta: So there’s a known known, and a known unknown. The known known is that Democrats are continuing to see erosion in their coalition, specific to African American men, Latino men, and to some degree young voters.And I think specifically if we’re looking at Detroit, at Milwaukee, at Philly, at Atlanta, at Maricopa County—there are places where we should be paying attention to this, right? I think the known unknown here is: Does Donald Trump get beaten up among suburban women, or does he get demolished among suburban women?And I think that the answer to that question is probably determinative to who is sworn into office on January 20.So I’m really paying very close attention to the collar counties outside of Philadelphia, to the WOW counties outside of Milwaukee. You have to look at Vegas and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. Some of these places—I don’t want to be reductive, but I really do feel like, ultimately, that’s where the election is going to be won or lost.Rosin: Both of you are saying: Look for signs. It’s not just big, broad swing states, but there are meaningful signs in smaller election results that you’ll be looking for.Alberta: That’s right. It’s, again, it’s just a numbers game. And it so happens that the most dense, vote-rich areas of persuadable voters are just consistently found in these once re,d then purple, now pretty blue suburbs. And so whether you’re watching the presidential race or even if you’re looking for a potential upset in a Senate race, like in Texas, where Ted Cruz on paper looks like he’s going to win and maybe even win comfortably. But pay attention to Harris County, Texas, which, on Election Night in 2012, Obama and Romney fought Harris County to basically a draw. I think it was a matter of a few hundred votes that separated them. Fast-forward, you know, a decade. Democrats are carrying Harris County, which is the Houston suburbs—they’re carrying it by a quarter-million votes, 300,000 votes reliably, and that number’s only going up.So those are the parts of the country where I think if you’re paying close attention, you’ll start to get a pretty good idea.Rosin: Okay. I think we have options for the meditators and options for those who cannot bring themselves to meditate. Thank you both for joining me on this day before the election.Leibovich: Thank you, Hanna. Thank you, Tim.Alberta: Mark, I’ll call you tomorrow. We can meditate together.Leibovich: I look forward to it. Yep, we’ll join figurative hands.Rosin: This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid. It was engineered by Rob Smierciak. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor.I’m Hanna Rosin, and we’ll be back later this week to cover the election, though possibly earlier than our usual Thursday release, depending on the results.Thanks for listening.More StoriesWhat Pete Hegseth’s Nomination Is Really AboutDemocrats’ Immigration Problem

ith the general election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump upon us, endorsements from high-profile figures hold much significance. Especially those that involve crossing party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former Governor of California, spoke out on Wednesday, Oct. 30, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), endorsing Harris over Trump. He joins a growing number of Republicans who have decided to vote Democrat this November.Here is a list of the prominent Republicans crossing party lines and voting for Harris over Trump in the 2024 election: Actor and former Governor of California Schwarzenegger endorsed Democratic nominee Harris for President over his fellow Republican, Trump, in a lengthy social media post. Schwarzenegger said he does not typically give endorsements, as he doesn’t “trust most politicians,” but he understands why people want to know his opinions since he is “not just a celebrity,” but also a former Governor.“To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a [sic] trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious,” he wrote. “And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”“I’m sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do,” he elaborated. “You don’t recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.”On Sept. 6, Former Vice President and influential Republican Dick Cheney released a statement announcing his endorsement of Harris for President. Speaking out against the Republican nominee, Cheney said that Trump can “never be trusted with power again.”Cheney, who served as Vice President under President George W. Bush between 2001 and 2009, went on to say that American citizens have a “duty” to prioritize the nation over partisan politics.“In our nation’s 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in his statement. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” he continued, referencing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.Dick Cheney’s endorsement came a week after his daughter, former Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney said that she’d vote for Harris.“As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares deeply about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses—not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” Cheney said on Sept. 4 at a Sanford School of Public Policy event at Duke University in North Carolina.Cheney served as vice-chair of the Jan. 6 committee and was one of two Republicans on the panel—something that Trump called to have her jailed for.Former Illinois Rep. and Republican Adam Kinzinger became a staunch critic of Trump after the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and spoke about endorsing Harris on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago in August. He encouraged other Republicans who wish to “defend democracy and decency” to do the same.“I was a Republican for 12 years in Congress, and I still hold on to the label,” he said. “I know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and democracy, and she is dedicated to upholding all three in service to our country.”Anthony Scaramucci, the businessman who served as White House Director of Communications under Trump for 10 days in 2017, endorsed Harris, and has even said he is working alongside Harris on her campaign’s crypto policies.“Kamala Harris is capable and has a great team,” he said in July, via a social media post.Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan spoke at the DNC, arguing that he stands in front of the crowd “as an American” though he is a Republican too. He focused his speech on other Republicans who may be watching, saying that the “party is not civil or conservative. It’s chaotic and crazy.” Duncan referred to Trump as a “direct threat to democracy.”“To my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back towards policy, empathy, and tone, you know the right thing to do. Now let’s have the courage to do it in November,” he said.Republican former Senator and Arizona representative Jeff Flake posted a statement to X on Sept. 29, announcing his support of the Harriz-Walz ticket, though he still calls himself a “conservative Republican.” He noted that he served with both Harris and Walz in Congress and that he knows “first hand” how much they love America.“I want to support a Presidential candidate who seeks to unite our country rather than one who divides us,” he wrote. “In times like these, there is nothing more conservative than putting country over party.”More than 200 Republicans who worked for both Bush Presidents, the late Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Mitt Romney released an open letter in August, declaring endorsement of Harris. In their letter, which was first reported by USA Today, the former staff members wrote that they were reiterating the 2020 decision by George W. Bush, McCain, and Romney alumni to “warn” against re-electing Trump. Now, they are “reuniting” to endorse Harris in 2024. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected,” they wrote. “The alternative, however, is simply untenable.”Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales endorsed Harris in an opinion piece published by Politico on Sept. 12.“As the United States approaches a critical election, I can’t sit quietly as Donald Trump—perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation—eyes a return to the White House,” he wrote, pointing specifically to the events of Jan. 6. “For that reason, though I’m a Republican, I’ve decided to support Kamala Harris for President.”Former Representative Denver Riggleman, who represented Virginia as a Republican, has endorsed Harris. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Aug. 9, Riggleman said: “What’s really going on is I think truth and facts need to be the baseline for this election. You can’t have an inveterate liar as President of the United States… It’s not about policy but the real reasons why Republicans should have the permission structure to vote for the Democratic ticket.”Former Michigan Republican Congressman Fred Upton, who served for three decades in the House of Representatives, endorsed Harris on Oct. 24“Watching Trump day after day, he's ignored the advice of many senior, respected Republicans to stay on the issues,” Upton told The Detroit News. “Instead, he's still talking about the election being stolen, trashing women left and right. He's just totally unhinged. We don't need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that's why I'm where I am.”Upton retired in 2022 after voting to impeach Trump the year before.Former New Hampshire Attorney General, Republican Tom Rath spoke to a local news station during the final week of October, stating that this is an “extraordinary moment in our history,” and explaining his endorsement of Harris."I think this is an election that completely oversteps any partisan identification," Rath said. "This is not a Republican vote or a Democratic vote. This is a vote that speaks to what we want ourselves to be and what we want our government to be."Former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey also shared strong words against Trump.“He's dangerous to our safety, dangerous to peace, dangerous to democracy and freedom,” Humphrey, who served two terms in the Senate from 1979-1990, said in the same local news interview with Rath. “I voted for Republicans for more than 50 years. I can't vote for Trump, as a father, as a grandfather, as a veteran, as a former U.S. Senator.”Former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who also served as Melania Trump’s Chief of Staff, appeared at the DNC, where she shared that Harris “has [her] vote.”At the convention, Grisham—who resigned after Jan 6.—took to the stage and said she felt  “very strongly” about speaking out.“I love my country more than my party,” Grisham said. “Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote.”Jimmy McCain, son of former Arizona Senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, endorsed Harris in September, also stating that he had changed his voter registration to Democrat.“She’ll bring everyone together. She'll bring that moderation, that bipartisanship that we've been missing for so long,” McCain told 12 News on Sept. 8, sharing that the Trump campaign’s conduct at Arlington National Cemetery was what instigated his Harris endorsement.State Senator for Wisconsin’s 2nd District, Republican Robert Cowles called Trump a “totalitarian” in an interview with Rational Revolution on Oct. 24, and stated he would be voting for Harris. Cowles said he is “ready” for the blowback of publicly announcing his decision. “We have to make a change here and Trump has to be defeated and we have to protect the Constitution and the country will go on, even with some liberal things that Harris might do,” he said.John Giles, Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, shared his endorsement of Harris in an opinion piece for the Arizona Republic in July. Giles has been Mayor of the third largest city in Arizona, a notable swing state in the upcoming election, since 2014.“The Republican Party with Trump at its helm continues down the path of political extremism, away from focusing on our fundamental freedoms,” Giles wrote in the op-ed. He went on to argue that Trump did not support Arizona cities and that Harris is the “competent, just, and fair leader” that the country “deserves."Former Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush, John Negroponte announced his support for Harris in a September letter signed by over 100 former national security officials from Republican Administrations and former Republican members of Congress.In the letter, the signatories wrote that they “expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues,” but they still “believe she possesses the essential qualities to serve as President and Donald Trump does not.” William Webster, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, was another  signatory of the letter with Negroponte. The letter also said that they “firmly oppose the election of Donald Trump,” arguing that as President he “promoted daily chaos in government, praised our enemies and undermined our allies, politicized the military and disparaged our veterans.”Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence, also signed the letter with Webster and Negroponte, endorsing Harris.Beyond that, Troye—who left the Trump-led White House in 2020—spoke at the DNC. There, she urged fellow Republicans to vote for Harris.“To my fellow Republicans: you aren't voting for a Democrat, you're voting for democracy,” she said. “You aren't betraying your party, you're standing up for our country.” Troye also wrote an opinion piece for MSNBC in which she called herself a “lifelong Republican,” but added that for President, there is “only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.”CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: The new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is taking shape, with several contentious hires in his proposed administration.Ahead of his return to the White House on 20 January 2025, the president-elect has named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and military veteran, as his pick for defence secretary. And he wants Robert F Kennedy Jr to be health secretary.Marco Rubio could be the next secretary of state. And billionaire supporter Elon Musk will play a role in cost-cutting.Here is a closer look at the posts he has named replacements for, and the names in the mix for the top jobs yet to be filled.We will start with the cabinet roles, which require approval from the US Senate. If four Republican senators and all the Democrats disagree to any individual then that nomination will fail.Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been picked for US secretary of state - the president's main adviser on foreign affairs, who acts as America's top diplomat when representing the country overseas.Rubio, 53, takes a hawkish view of China. He opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences.He has long been courting the job of the nation's top diplomat and if approved, he will be the first Latino secretary of state in US history.Pete Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host who has never held political office, has been nominated to be the next defence secretary.His appointment is one of the most highly anticipated in Trump's cabinet as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza rage on. "Nobody fights harder for the troops," Trump said.After Hegseth's appointment, it emerged that he was investigated in 2017 for an alleged sexual assault. He was never arrested or charged and denies the allegation.His lawyer also confirmed that he had paid a woman in the same year to stay quiet about an assault claim that he feared would cost him his job at Fox. Again, he denied any wrongdoing.Trump's first pick for attorney general, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration for the role Thursday after a week of controversy over a congressional investigation into sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him.Gaetz denied all of the claims, but said he wanted to avoid a "needlessly protracted Washington scuffle."About six hours after Gaetz withdrew, Trump named Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, as his successor."Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families," Trump wrote.Bondi served during Trump's first administration as a member of the Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission. And she was on his defence team during his first impeachment trial.Trump announced during a speech at Mar-a-Lago that he would ask Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to lead the Department of the Interior.A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth.If confirmed, Burgum will oversee an agency that is responsible for the management and conservation of federal lands and natural resources.RFK Jr, as he is known, an environmental lawyer, vaccine sceptic and the nephew of former President John F Kennedy, is Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Despite having no medical qualifications, Kennedy, 70, would have broad remit over US federal health agencies - including those that oversee approval of vaccines and pharmaceuticals.There has been speculation about his inability to pass a background check for security clearance due to past controversies, including dumping a bear carcass in New York's Central Park.Some of Kennedy’s own stated aims for government are bound up with misinformation - and many medical experts have expressed serious concerns about his nomination, citing his views on vaccines and other health matters.On other matters he has more support, for example in scrutinising the processing of food and the use of additives.Trump has nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration.The FDA is responsible for the safety of prescription drugs and vaccines as well as oversight of food and cosmetics."The Agency needs Dr. Marty Makary, a Highly Respected Johns Hopkins Surgical Oncologist and Health Policy Expert, to course-correct and refocus the Agency," Trump said in a statement Friday.Dr Makary is a Johns Hopkins University professor, author and surgeon, and he is a trained cancer specialist. He spoke to conservative media outlets during the Covid-29 pandemic, questioning the need for masks and expressing concerns over the Covid vaccine among young children. The American Academy of Pediatrics' stance was that even though the Covid death rate was low among young children, vaccinations helped reduce severe disease in children.Trump announced in his nomination that Dr Makary would be ideal to "course-correct and refocus the Agency"."FDA has lost the trust of Americans, and has lost sight of its primary goal as a regulator," he said.Dr Makary would require Senate approval and would serve under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, if both are confirmed.Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins has been chosen to lead the US Department of Veterans' Affairs.Collins was a Trump loyalist when he served in Congress from 2013-21. He was an outspoken advocate for the president-elect during both impeachment hearings.An Iraq war veteran who now serves as a chaplain in the US Air Force Reserve, Collins left Congress for an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in his home state of Georgia.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has been nominated for the key role of overseeing US security, including its borders, cyber-threats, terrorism and emergency response.The agency has a $62bn (£48bn) budget and employs thousands of people. It incorporates a wide variety of agencies under its umbrella, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Former congressman and Fox Business host Sean Duffy has been selected to lead the Department of Transportation.If confirmed by senators, he will take charge of aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at the transport department, with a roughly $110bn annual budget.In the role, the incoming secretary can expect to face a number of safety-related aviation issues, including the continued problems at Boeing, as the troubled manufacturer addresses a series of safety and quality issues.Oil and gas industry executive Chris Wright will lead the Department of Energy, where he is expected to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to "drill, baby, drill" and maximise US energy production.Wright, the founder-CEO of Liberty Energy, has called climate activists alarmist and likened Democrats' push for renewables to Soviet-style communism.In a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year, he said: "There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either."Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump's transition team and chief executive of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, has been picked to lead the US commerce department.Trump said Lutnick would spearhead the administration's "tariff and trade agenda".Lutnick had also been in the running for treasury secretary, a more high-profile role.World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) co-founder and Trump transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, has been appointed as Trump's nominee for education secretary.A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign.Trump has criticised the Department of Education, and has promised to close the agency down - a job McMahon could be tasked with.In his statement announcing her nomination, Trump said McMahon would "spearhead" the effort to "send Education BACK TO THE STATES", in reference to the pledge.Scott Bessent has been nominated to lead the US Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for liberal billionaire George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and would bring a relatively conventional resume to the role.On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a "new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes"."[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda," Trump said, adding that Bessent would "support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances."Russell Vought has been selected to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a post he held during Trump's first term.Vought previously served as the director of the agency, which helps craft the president's budget, acts as the central regulatory gatekeeper and executes the president's agenda across the government.He also authored a key chapter in Project 2025, a 900-page conservative wish-list that sought to expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision.Vought served as the Republican National Committee’s 2024 platform policy director."He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term," Trump said in announcing Vought. "We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!"Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been selected by Trump to lead the US Department of Labor - which oversees worker health and safety, workforce laws and administers unemployment and workers compensation.Chavez-DeRemer has been serving in the US Congress since 2023 but lost a re-election bid in Oregon in the November election, despite winning strong trade union support.Scott Turner, an NFL veteran and motivational speaker, has been chosen to lead the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.The department oversees America's housing needs, enforces laws, prevents discrimination and provides assistance to those in need, through both low-income housing and helping Americans avoid foreclosure.Turner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term. He previously served in the Texas legislature.Brooke Rollins grew up on a farm, but her most recent job was as co-founder and head of the America First Policy Institute, a Maga-backed think tank.During the president-elect's first administration, she served as director of the Office of American Innovation and acting director of the Domestic Policy Council.According to Trump's press release, Rollins graduated from the Texas A&M University with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in agriculture development and later obtained her law degree from the same university.As agriculture secretary, she will be oversee farm subsidies, federal nutrition programmes, meat inspections and other facets of the country's agricultural industry.Outside the 15 department heads who make up the core of the cabinet, there are several other roles that are often given cabinet-rank, like the FBI director and the head of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). These roles will also require the nominees to be confirmed by the Senate.However, there will be other key roles in the Trump administration that will not require Senate confirmation and the people filling these roles - like Elon Musk - will not have to be vetted in the same way.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has been tapped to lead what Trump has termed a Department of Government Efficiency, alongside one-time presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy.The department - whose acronym Doge is a nod to a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk - will serve in an advisory capacity to "dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies", Trump said.It is unclear what approval process will be necessary for these roles.This is a critical job because it includes responsibility for Trump's mass deportations of millions of undocumented migrants, which was a central campaign pledge.Homan is a former police officer who was acting director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Trump's first term and has advocated a zero-tolerance stance on the issue."I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen," he said in July.Lee Zeldin, a former New York congressman, has agreed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), both he and Trump said. The Senate will still need to confirm his appointment.He will be in charge of tackling America's climate policy in this role.While serving in congress from 2015 to 2023, Zeldin voted against expanding a number of environmental policies. He has already said he plans to "roll back regulations" from day one.New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been tapped to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations.Stefanik has made national headlines with her sharp questioning in congressional committees.Trump has chosen his former director of national intelligence, ex-Texas congressman John Ratcliffe, to serve as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director.There are other yet-to-be-appointed key positions running intelligence agencies, including the FBI and director of national intelligence.Trump has said he would fire FBI Director Chris Wray, whom he nominated in 2017, but has since fallen out with. Jeffrey Jensen, a former Trump-appointed US attorney, has been under consideration to replace Wray.Trump has named former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard, as director of national intelligence.The former US Army Reserve officer once campaigned with Senator Bernie Sanders and ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, but has turned toward the Republicans in recent years.She campaigned with Trump in 2024 and served on his transition team.Florida congressman Michael Waltz has been selected as the next national security adviser.In a statement on Tuesday announcing Waltz's appointment, Trump noted that Waltz is the first green beret - or member of the US Army Special Forces - to be elected to Congress.Waltz will have to help navigate the US position on the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.Trump has picked real estate investor and philanthropist Steve Witkoff for the role of special envoy to the Middle East.Witkoff is a close friend of Trump's, who was with the former president when a man allegedly tried to assassinate him at his Palm Beach golf club in September.Trump has described him as a "highly respected leader in business and philanthropy, who has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous".Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be US ambassador to Israel, as Trump pledges to end the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.“Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years," the president-elect said in a statement.Huckabee is a staunchly pro-Israel official who has previously rejected the idea of a two-state solution to solve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has been nominated to be the US Ambassador to Nato - the alliance Trump has regularly criticised, and has even previously threatened to withdraw from completely."Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended," Trump said in a statement."Matt will strengthen relationships with our Nato Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST."Whitaker is a high school football star turned lawyer who has served as a US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. He has little experience of foreign policy.Trump has selected Dean John Sauer to be US solicitor general to supervise and conduct government litigation in the US Supreme Court.Sauer previously served as solicitor general for the Missouri state supreme court for six years, and worked as a clerk for former US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.He also represented Trump earlier this year in several of his court cases, including his US Supreme Court immunity case.Brendan Carr is a current member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates broadcast and internet use. A longtime establishment Republican, in recent years he has embraced Trump's priorities and emerged as a supporter of regulation of "big tech"."Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others have played central roles in the censorship cartel," he wrote on X. "The censorship cartel must be dismantled."Trump has previously vowed to strip TV channels he considers biased of their broadcasting licenses.Mehmet Oz has been chosen to run the powerful agency that oversees the healthcare of millions of Americans. He, too, will need to be confirmed by the US Senate next year before he officially takes charge.Oz trained as a surgeon before finding fame on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the early 2000s. He later hosted a TV programme of his own.“There may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr Oz to make America healthy again," Trump said.Oz has been criticised by experts for promoting what they called bad health advice about weight loss drugs and "miracle" cures, and suggesting malaria drugs as a cure for Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic.These jobs are in the West Wing - his key advisers.Susie Wiles and campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita were the masterminds behind Trump's victory over Kamala Harris.The chief of staff is a cabinet member and often a president's top aide, overseeing daily operations in the West Wing and managing the boss's staff.Wiles, 67, has worked in Republican politics for decades, from Ronald Reagan’s successful 1980 presidential campaign to electing Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis as governors of Florida.Stephen Miller, who has been Trump’s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump’s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration.During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.Republican lawyer William McGinley will take on the role of White House counsel, Trump has said.“Bill is a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement,” he said in a statement.McGinley served as White House cabinet secretary during part of Trump’s first term and was the Republican National Committee’s counsel for election integrity in 2024.Karoline Leavitt, 27, will become the youngest person to serve as White House press secretary in US history when Donald Trump returns to office.She ran for Congress, winning the Republican nomination for New Hampshire in 2022, only to lose in the general election to Democrat Chris Pappas.Leavitt also served in the White House press office during the first Trump administration, including as an assistant press secretary, according to the website for her run for Congress.The public will soon see Leavitt in the iconic spot behind the podium in the White House briefing room - a space that led to countless tense exchanges between members of the press and officials in Trump's first administration.Steven Cheung joined Trump's team in 2016 as his campaign spokesman, and will soon take on a top communications role in the White House.Raised by Chinese immigrant parents in California, Cheung started out as an intern under then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has also been the spokesman for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Cheung became known for his fierce, and often offensive, attacks towards Trump's opponents. He has said Joe Biden "slowly shuffles around like he has a full diaper in his pants" and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis walks like a girl who “discovered heels for the first time”.During his first administration, Trump had an unusually high turnover of communications directors - six different people. Anthony Scaramucci infamously only lasted 11 days in the role.Sergio Gor is a business partner of Trump's son, Donald Jr. He is the president and co-founder of the younger Trump's publishing company, Winning Team Publishing, which has published a book by the president-elect."Steven Cheung and Sergio Gor have been trusted advisers since my first presidential campaign in 2016, and have continued to champion America First principles," Trump said in a statement.Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University.The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump.BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election.Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers.Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump.Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs.The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded "an insult".Catch up on the key moments from election night.The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters.The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win – but data shows that most voters picked someone else.Trump tapped Matt Gaetz, who faces a House ethics investigation, to be the US's top law enforcement officer.The 59-year-old was the first woman to head Florida's justice system and she is a longtime Trump ally.The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.Bondi, 59, is a former Florida attorney general and long-time ally of Trump.

CONTENT: W
ith another election days away that could return Donald Trump to the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris will be making her closing arguments to voters next week at The Ellipse, an expansive, 52-acre oval lawn in Washington between the White House and the National Mall.The location is no accident. It’s where Trump encouraged his supporters to help him overturn his election loss on Jan. 6, 2021, setting off a violent storming of the Capitol. “If Mike Pence does the right thing,” Trump told the crowd he had gathered that day, “we win the election.” It was a lie. Aides had told Trump beforehand that Pence had no authority to change the result. For Harris, the echoes of the recent past on that lawn are the point. As polling shows her and Trump essentially tied in the seven battleground states, the Harris campaign believes emphasizing the former President’s admiration for dictators and vindictive talk is the right approach in the home stretch. Focus groups in those critical states have found that undecided voters are more likely to support Harris when she talks about turning the page on Trump’s dark worldview and when they are reminded of the many people who have worked closely with Trump and don’t trust him to be President again, according to a campaign aide.Recent reports of former top Trump officials describing him as fascist has helped the campaign lean into that message. Harris has increasingly used the word to describe Trump in recent days. A digital ad the Harris campaign released Thursday shows menacing black and white images of Trump as a voiceover from Harris cites his admiration for dictators and calls him, “unstable and unfit to serve.”It’s a strategy that the campaign intends to continue to tee up in the coming days and emphasize further in her speech at The Ellipse on Tuesday. Harris wants Americans to be reminded of what Trump said there on Jan. 6, and link it to the former President’s recent comments laying out his autocratic vision for the Presidency. That event will follow a high-profile rally on Friday in Houston where Beyonce is expected to perform and is intended to highlight Republican abortion bans.Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media platform that Harris’ latest critiques of him come from “her warped mind” and she’s stepped them up because she “sees that she is losing.”A recent Trump town hall hosted by Univision gave the Harris camp plenty of new fodder. Trump said he wants “extreme power” and called his opponents “dangerous people” and the “enemy from within.” He also called Jan. 6 a “day of love” in which "nothing" was "done wrong."  Given a chance on Fox News to explain those comments, Trump doubled down, saying there was “beauty” to Jan. 6 and “it’s accurate” to call fellow Americans “enemies.”The Harris campaign is also amplifying striking comments coming from Trump’s own former senior officials. John Kelly, who was Trump’s longest serving White House chief of staff and was Secretary of Homeland Security, told the New York Times that Trump “prefers the dictator approach to government” and recalled that Trump had told him “Hitler did some good things too.” Mark Milley, Trump’s former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Trump “fascist to the core,” according to a book from Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward.Read more: Former Trump Aides Warn of Secret Presidential Crisis PowersThis represents a shift for Harris. After President Joe Biden made Trump’s threat to democracy an animating force of his successful run for President in 2020, he continued that strategy as his party defended the Senate in 2022 and in the re-election bid he formally kicked off in early 2024. Some party leaders complained that Biden needed to be talking more about issues like the economy. When Biden dropped out in late July, Harris took a different tack. As she reintroduced herself to the American public, Harris initially stepped away from the gloomy predictions about a Trump autocracy and projected a forward-looking message that emphasized what she would do to reduce housing and health care costs and roll back abortion restrictions. Instead of talking about the stark danger to democracy Trump poses, Harris described herself as a former prosecutor who knew how to make a forceful case against Trump to voters. That was clear the day she took over Biden’s Wilmington campaign headquarters. Harris told gathered staff that her campaign “is not just about us versus Donald Trump.” Someone in the room shouted, “Preach!”But, now, with just over a week remaining until the polls close, Harris’ final pitch to the voters is very much about drawing that same contrast with Trump that Biden emphasized for years. That’s been driven in part by the increasing frequency of comments from Trump that is raising anxiety among many voters about what he would do if he reclaimed presidential power. But as the race has tightened, the Harris campaign also thinks that ringing those alarm bells are what will push the few remaining voters not already in a declared camp over to her side.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: By Juana Summers, Jason Fuller, Patrick JarenwattananonMembers of the class of 2016 are presented with their degrees during the commencement ceremony at Howard University in May, 2016.The absolute number of Black men enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is the lowest it's been since 1976.That's according to recent analysis from the American Institute for Boys and Men, which crunched data from the Department of Education.In fact, Black men now currently account for only 26% of the students at HBCUs — back in 1976, that figure was 38%.All Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Calvin Hadley — assistant provost for academic partnerships and student engagement at Howard University — about what's happening, what's lost when Black men don't attend HBCUs, and how he is trying to close this gap.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Juana Summers: I want to start by talking about Howard, which, of course, is one of the foremost HBCUs in this country — a long, long list that I cannot recite of incredible alumni, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Let's start there. Are you seeing this decline among Black male students where you are?Calvin Hadley: I am. I'm a Howard alum, and so I remember as a student, the numbers were also pretty stark at that time. I think we were around 33-34% when I was a student, between 2004 and 2008. Now, as you announced in your introduction, Howard University is around 25% male total. And I think a recent statistics said around 19% Black male. And so that is felt on campus, that is felt, I think, in our social clubs, it's felt on the yard. And I think many of our male students have commented that in some of their classes, they're the only male in their class.Vice President Kamala Harris greets supporters at a campaign rally at South Carolina State University in February.Summers: So I will just say, I did not attend an HBCU. I attended a PWI — a predominantly white institution — but I have so many friends and family members who attended HBCUs. They talk to me about what that experience has meant to them, not just while they're on campus, but when they go out into their professional lives. They stay connected to the HBCU experience. They stay connected to communities like the Howard community that you represent. So I just want to ask you, when there are fewer Black men on campus, walk us through: what does that mean? What do we lose when those Black men are not as robust a presence on campuses like yours?Hadley: By the time students actually come to college, we're dealing with the males that have actually transcended what we call the “belief gap” — this gap in between what students can actually achieve and what their professors, teachers, counselors believe they can achieve. For Black males, that gap is the largest. When they get into the campus, the campus experiences are significantly impacted by the imbalance, right?At every educational institution, we want a diversity of experience. And so when you don't have as many males in the classroom, that diversity of experience is significantly impacted. It gets even more scary when we trace it forward, right? I think we're dealing with some really unique statistics right now. Black males are graduating at a much lower rate than Black females.Summers: And that's across all colleges.Hadley: Across all colleges, not just HBCUs. And so this drop in the past decade has been seen more drastically. But the reality is, this is not a Howard problem. This is not an HBCU problem. This is not a PWI problem. This is an American education problem.Summers: I want to shift gears a bit and talk about what happens when these Black men are graduating from high school and they're deciding what comes next, what that next step is. The study that we've been talking about, it notes that since 2010, as you point out, Black male enrollment has gone down across all colleges. And it also points out that HBCU enrollment has also decreased on the whole, but the decline of Black male enrollment at HBCUs outpaces those trends, if only slightly. Can you just explain to me how you understand that gap?Hadley: So I want to take a small step back. In 2013-14 we had 2990 male applicants for Howard University specifically. In 2022-23 we had 9705. A significant, significant increase.Howard University graduates arrive for the 2023 Commencement Ceremony in May, 2023.Summers: And what does that say to you?Hadley: That the Howard University education, and the HBCU education, is highly sought after, right? And there are a number of really important things that happened between 2012 and 2022 — one of those was the election of President Donald Trump, another was the murder of George Floyd. I think when those things happen in the United States of America, the HBCU experience, which had already been known to many of us, had now become a much more attractive proposition. You notice a significant increase in those male applications.What I didn't provide you was the number of female applications that accompany that. While we received 9700 male applications in 2022-23, we received upwards of 30,000 female applications. And I want to take a step aside and say Black women are ripping it up. All the statistics show, from high school to college to college graduation, that the Black women is successful today, and the trajectory is going straight up. Unfortunately, when you look at the Black male, the exact opposite is the case. And so for those Black males that are now being left out of the college equation, that also means they're being left out and stratified out of a certain portion of our society.What we now will have is an imbalance in the community that has a significant impact on our ability to create whole families, I think. On the ability for us to ensure that our generations after us have additional success, and really to have additional mobility.Summers: I want to end on this: You are a product of Howard University, as you point out. You now work for the university. And you're raising two young Black boys. What's your pitch for why a young Black man who might be hearing our conversation in 2024 should choose to attend an HBCU?Hadley: Wow. Thank you for that. You attend an HBCU for an education and not a degree, and as an assistant provost, that's not a popular thing to say. The education that you receive in an HBCU transcends the classroom experience. It transcends the relationship that you have with your professor. The education exists in between the lines of the pages. HBCUs inundate you with the sense of belief. We talked about the importance of that belief on the front end, the belief gap that exists in K through 12.HBCUs are created to instill you with the belief that you can be even larger than you can dream. Howard University and the HBCU community has provided me — and many other people, like our vice president — with the sense that I am enough. I can be successful academically. But my world is not simply academics. I can be enough and I can contribute to this society, in this space, in a way that allows me to feel whole and allows me to contribute to something much larger than myself. The HBCU community needs you. And so when I'm talking to that young man in 2024: Come because we need you. Come because you're important. Come because without you, our community is hurt.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
