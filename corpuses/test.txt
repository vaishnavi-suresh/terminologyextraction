CONTENT: The election has been over for weeks and, honestly, reacting to it is starting to get boring. So, let us skip to the point of this column. It's perfectly fine that people are out here blocking each other on social media or cutting each other off in real life as we head into the holidays and the new Trump administration. More than that, it makes total sense, and I support it. Also, people ditching X, formerly known as Twitter, is long overdue. They’re not running to the dreaded “safe spaces.” They’re running to peace. Conservatives have been doing that for years.But I’ll get to that later. The most significant lie people are telling themselves is that this conversation is about "politics." Imagine that. Imagine blocking and ignoring someone because of something so passé as "politics." We have all disagreed on politics for generations. It's the foundation of our governmental and voting systems. One side thinks we need less taxes, for example, and another is fine with taxes if it helps improve quality of life. Or whatever. Do we disagree on the economy? Cool. Disagree on whether we need gun control? Fine. These are the usual "politics" and have long made family gatherings worth attending.Opinion:You surprised Trump wants RFK Jr. in charge of health? Republicans voted for it.That's not what this is. This, my friends, is about the core beliefs we all hold near and dear to our identity. This is about what each side believes people can do in their own lives. This is about who can exist and where they’re allowed to exist. This is about what our children will be taught in schools. This is about whether or not a woman and her doctor have control of their health care decisions. This is deeper than the shallow political disagreements many of us secretly love. It's more than the passive-aggressive social media URL sharing we've engaged with since the inception of the internet. Let me put it another way. I am one generation from family members who came to America from Mexico. My family is here because of a guest worker program that today’s political climate would never allow, mostly because of Republicans. I grew up, went to school and lived my life with the very people many of you think should be part of Donald Trump’s promised militarized mass deportation. I am them. They are me. We are who you voted against.Opinion:Gen Z voters were the biggest disappointment of the election. Why did we fail?Why would I sit at the same table and pass the stuffing around with those voters on Thanksgiving?I’m not even judging or dismissing people who voted for that. It makes sense to me that people who have no connection to that community would follow the Trumpian scare tactics and vote for that. It honestly does. It’s easy to dismiss members of a community you don’t know. Now, it makes no sense that people from that community would vote for it, but everybody had a decision to make.But I’m not breaking bread with that. No chance.Now, carry that thought process over to social media, where a flurry of people are finally ditching X, formerly known as Twitter, for Bluesky, which recently hit 20 million users. I can tell you from experience that many of the people leaving Elon Musk’s vision of “free speech” are doing it to find a moment of peace from the nonstop arguing and agitation that social media has become. That doesn't come from staying on X and watching Musk spread all his nonsense.Sure, progressives are licking their wounds from Vice President Kamala Harris' loss. But riddle me this. How is that different from what Republicans did during the entirety of Joe Biden's presidency? Are we supposed to ignore the list of conservative social media safe spaces? Are we just going to pretend that Gab, Rumble and Truth Social don't exist? I'm not even naming all of them. Wait, didn't somebody create a conservative dating app?And, I guess, that means we're also ignoring the lucrative cottage industry of conservative media outlets that have dominated Republican messaging meant to create and feed political thought islands.Fox News, Breitbart, Daily Caller and One America News Network don't exist, right?Conservatives haven't spent years huddling in their digital safe spaces echoing each other, right?Wait, no. They totally did. Progressives seem to be waking up to the idea that they can do the same. Let's not even get into the "patriots" who were so triggered by Trump's 2020 loss they stormed the U.S. Capitol.Like it or not, we're in a state of American politics where the debates are no longer about mundane Republican versus Democratic policies. Anybody who believes they can share a plate of turkey in the current environment probably has nothing at stake that is dear to their existence.In which case, enjoy the arguments. The rest of us probably won't hear them.Louie Villalobos is Gannett's director of opinion. If you feel compelled to reach out, try Bluesky. Honestly, who still uses Twitter, or X, or whatever it's called?

CONTENT: MAGA adherents deny and dismiss what they are a part of, but they believe Trump’s lies, and will support him until the end.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.At a rally just outside Atlanta in late October, thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up in the punishing southern sun to see their hero; some had driven hours from out of state. Vendors hawked T-shirts with slogans such as say no to the ho, and roses are red, hunter smokes crack, joe biden has dementia and kamala isn’t black, sometimes chanting the phrases out loud to amused onlookers.Hundreds of people still standing in the winding queue shuffled off into a disappointed crowd when told that the venue was now full. Many hung around outside, browsing the vendors’ wares or grabbing a bite at one of the nearby food trucks. They were there to see Trump, but also to enjoy the sense of belonging that comes from being surrounded by the like-minded. They were there to see and be seen, dressed in MAGA hats, MAGA shirts, MAGA tights. Service dogs decked out in stars and stripes, men in silk shirts printed with an image of a bloodied Trump raising his fist. As “Y.M.C.A.” blared from inside the venue, Trump supporters stopped their conversations to sing along and shape their arms with the chorus.The first time Trump ran for president as a Republican, when I spoke with his followers I encountered a superficial denial of Trump’s prejudice that suggested a quiet approval of it. They would deny that Trump made bigoted remarks or proposed discriminatory policies while also defending those remarks and policies as necessary. What I found this time around were people who were far more deeply embedded in an unreality carefully molded by the Trump campaign and right-wing media to foment a sense of crisis—and a belief that they were being exploited by a shadowy conspiracy that Trump alone could vanquish. Whereas many supporters I spoke with at rallies in 2016 rationalized or dismissed Trump’s yarns as exaggerations or bombast, in 2024 they would repeat them solemnly and earnestly, as gospel.The conspiracy theories, particularly surrounding immigration, are significant because they justify extreme measures—Trump’s promises to strip critical news outlets of their broadcast licenses, prosecute political rivals, and purge the federal government of “the enemy within.” Yet some supporters I spoke with also seemed either unaware or disbelieving of the plans that Trump and his allies have for a second administration. There is a disconnect between what Trump and his allies intend to do in power and what many of the people who would vote him in believe he would do.This disconnect was apparent earlier in the 2024 campaign, when Democrats began attacking Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation “blueprint” for a second Trump administration. The agenda contemplates not only a political purge of the federal government, and a president who can order the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies, but drastic limits on abortion; drastic cuts to education, the social safety net, and efforts to fight climate change; and using federal powers to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Although Project 2025 was not affiliated with the campaign, it was largely a Trumpworld project, conceived by former Trump aides. Trump surmised that his own followers would not support what was in Project 2025 and distanced himself from it, posting late one night in July that he knew “nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it.” (CNN reported that at least 140 people who worked for Trump were involved in the project, including six of his former Cabinet members.) Its architects were left to quietly reassure their fellow travelers that he was saying this for political reasons. “He’s running against the brand,” Russell Vought, a Project 2025 contributor and potential future Trump chief of staff, told an undercover reporter. “He’s very supportive of what we do.”I noticed a particular disconnect on immigration; people I spoke with emphasized their support for legal immigration and, unlike Trump, did not single out particular ethnicities or nationalities for scorn. They said they would welcome anyone as long as they came legally. It’s possible that this was merely something they were telling themselves they believed so as not to interrogate their own motives further. They were ultimately also in thrall to Trump’s narrative about how Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were conspiring to repopulate the country with undocumented immigrants living on the dole at their expense. That fiction was not just a source of rage but a predicate for whatever radical action might be needed to rectify it.One Trump voter I met among the cheerful crowd of supporters milling around outside a packed rally outside Atlanta, who identified himself only as Steve and said he worked in telecommunications, managed to touch on virtually every immigration conspiracy theory put forth by the Trump campaign in about 30 seconds. Yet even Steve told me the issue was people coming in illegally, not that they were coming in at all. “You’re not coming in legally; you’re not pledging to the country; you’re not saying you’re going to support that country,” Steve said.Adam Serwer: The cruelty is the pointAnother Trump supporter named Rebecca Cruz told me, “We need immigration in this country, but we need safe, safe immigration.” Referring to the Biden administration, she explained that “they take them from other countries, bringing them. They’re going into certain countries, and they fly them in here … because they want to destroy America. They hate what America stands for.”A few days earlier, at another Trump rally, in Greenville, North Carolina, the crowd cheered when Trump demanded that news outlets be taken off the air for criticizing him or for giving positive coverage to Harris. They laughed when Trump played a bizarre video mocking trans people in the military. They cheered for the death penalty. They booed when Senator Ted Budd warned that Harris would let “the illegals who are here … use your taxpayer dollars for transgender surgeries.” Trump insisted that “Kamala Harris has imported an army of illegal-alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, not just South America.” Trump repeated “the Congo” three times, in case the audience didn’t understand that the immigrants he was attacking were Black. He would occasionally pay lip service to legal immigration, or vow to defend Americans of “any color and creed,” but this was only after invoking a litany of stereotypes designed to justify state violence against whichever marginalized group he had just finished demonizing.When I spoke with people one-on-one, they reflected back to me Trump’s rhetoric, occasionally with a somewhat more human touch. A retired English teacher who did not want to give her name emphasized that “I believe in immigration, but do it legally. Don’t make your first act of coming to America be coming illegally … We’re taking away from servicing children who don’t even get to eat because you’re giving housing to the people coming in.” Another retiree in North Carolina, named Theresa Paul, gave me a hard look and said she was supporting Trump because “when you take illegals over our citizens, that’s treason … We’re being worked to death, taxed to death, and for what? So we can put up people that’s coming in illegally, and putting them up way superior to us.” I asked her why she thought the Biden administration would want to do that. She grasped my arm lightly and said, “To replace us, right?”I began to realize that these Trump fans—diehards though they may be—represent a distinct space in the MAGA landscape. They enjoy his cruelty, seeing it as righteous vengeance for the constellation of wrongs they have been told they are the victims of, but they aren’t the architects of these conspiracy theories, and neither do they stand to profit from them. Their conspiracism serves to distract them from Trump’s actual policy agenda and his authoritarian ambitions.There are, I’ve come to see, three circles of MAGA that make up the Trump coalition. The innermost circle comprises the most loyal Trump allies, who wish to combine a traditional conservative agenda of gutting the welfare state and redistributing income upward while executing by force a radical social reengineering of America to resemble right-wing nostalgia of the 1950s. Trump’s advisers and other conservative-movement figures understand Trump’s populism as a smoke screen designed to conceal their agenda of cutting taxes for the wealthy, banning abortion, eviscerating the social safety net, and slashing funding for education, health care, and other support for low-income people. All of this is consistent with how Trump governed when he was in the White House, although many people seem to have forgotten what he was actually like. This faction wants a government that works to preserve traditional hierarchies of race, gender, and religion, or at least one that does not seek to interfere with what it sees as the natural order of things.This innermost circle includes legislative allies such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act; policy aides such as Vought, who has spoken of mass deportation as a means to “end multiculturalism”; and elite backers such as Elon Musk, who hopes to use his influence to inflict hardship on Americans by dramatically cutting the welfare state so that he can reduce his own tax burden. It is no coincidence that Musk has transformed the social network formerly known as Twitter into a haven for racist pseudoscience that he himself consciously amplifies.This faction also includes those far-right figures who are not official members of Trumpworld but who see the reality-show star as a champion of a resurgent white-nationalist identity. These people understand what Trumpism’s goals are, and most of them also understand that, absent the particular devotion Trump inspires, their plans would not be politically viable.There is a second, slightly larger circle around this first one, comprising devoted Trump fans. These fans are the primary target for a sanitized version of the “Great Replacement” theory, which holds that American elites have conspired to dispossess them of what they have in order to give it to unauthorized immigrants who do not belong. They are not ideologically hostile to the welfare state—indeed, many of them value it—but they believe it is being wasted on those who have no claim to it. People in this circle are acting rationally in response to conspiracy theories they have chosen to believe, and are bewildered by those who refuse to acknowledge what they are certain is true. This bewilderment serves only to further cement their feeling that they are the victims of an elite plot to take from them that which they deserve. This is the group you might refer to as true believers.In a different political and informational environment, many of these true believers would be unlikely to support the Project 2025 agenda—or at least not much of it—but here they are so isolated from mainstream news sources that they believe Trump’s claims that he has no ties to it, and that he has their best interests in mind because “he cannot be bought” by the same elites they believe are responsible for their hardships.Then there is the outer circle: Americans with conservative beliefs who may be uneasy about Trump but whose identification with conservative principles and the Republican Party mean they wish to persuade themselves to vote for the Republican candidate. They may be ardently anti-abortion, or small-business owners, or deeply religious. They do not believe everything Trump says; in fact, their approach to the man is dismissiveness. These are voters who fall into what my colleague David Graham calls the “believability gap.” They don’t like Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric but also don’t think he will follow through with it. This is the “What’s the downside for humoring him?” faction.This group of Trump voters treat his authoritarianism as mere bombast or as exaggerations from the media, seeing this election as an ordinary one in which a party with a bad economic record should be replaced by a party with a better one, not an election in which a man who tried to destroy American democracy is running for a chance to finish the job.Denial is the mortar that holds the three MAGA circles together. The innermost circle denies the radicalism of its agenda to the middle ring of fervent Trump supporters, presenting any criticism as the lies of the same liberal elites responsible for dispossessing real Americans of what is owed them. The outer circle treats Trump’s authoritarianism and racism as regrettable and perhaps too colorful, but equivalent or similar to other common character defects possessed by all politicians. To acknowledge the liberal critique of Trump as correct would amount to a painful step away from a settled political identity that these outer-circle members are not willing to take—they would have to join the Never Trumpers in exile.As different as some of the people I spoke with at these Trump rallies could be, when they went into the crowd, they experienced the ecstasy of the cruelties they would perhaps not allow themselves to indulge in alone. The rationalizations and explanations and denial melted away. They understood that they were there to mock and condemn those they hate and fear, and to listen to all of Trump’s vows to punish them.A person, alone in conversation, can be rational. People, in a crowd, become something else.Conspiracism is not an inherently right-wing indulgence. After September 11, many in liberal circles fell for nonsense alleging that the Bush administration was secretly behind the attacks. After George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004, some liberals indulged absurd theories about voting machines in Ohio switching votes and thus delivering the state to Bush. More recently, conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Trump being staged spread in certain liberal circles online.Political leaders, intellectuals, and public figures can play a crucial role in containing such conspiracism. Democratic leaders shamed 9/11 truthers out of the party. John Kerry conceded the election rather than champion baseless allegations about voter fraud. Unlike Trump, who gleefully promoted conspiracy theories around the violent assault on Nancy Pelosi’s husband, no prominent Democrats embraced any of the conspiracy theories that emerged about the attempt on Trump’s life. But when elites cultivate and indulge conspiracism—when they exploit it—they can create the conditions for authoritarianism and political violence.“In social movements … conspiracy theories that may be absurd and specious on their face nevertheless contain valid information about the motivations, grievances, insecurities, and even panics among their promoters, so they cannot be simply dismissed,” the historian Linda Gordon wrote in The Second Coming of the KKK. “Among Klan leaders, conspiracy theories also did a great deal of organizing work: they provided identifiable and unifying targets, supplying a bonding function that explanations based on historical analyses do not deliver.” Political and national identities of any ideology can be forged by the sense that some part of your identity is under assault. When that assault does not truly exist, conspiracism can provide it.Trumpist conspiracy theories perform a similar function. In his stump speeches, the former president calls the United States an “occupied country” that will be “liberated” from criminal migrants when he retakes power. He tells his audience that crime by undocumented immigrants is not simply a social problem that might be solved with more restrictive immigration policy but a deliberate plan by those in office. “Kamala is importing millions of illegals across our borders and giving them taxpayer benefits at your expense,” Trump declared in Greenville.Humiliation is an essential part of the Trumpist style. Trump appeals to his audiences’ pride by telling them they have been hoodwinked by their adversaries, but that he has the power to avenge this injustice. Invoking that sense of humiliation is part of how he primes his audiences to be manipulated, knowing that their sense of shame will make them both angry and eager to reassert that pride. It is one of the most obvious con-man tricks in history—you got scammed, you paid too much, but if you give me your money, I’ll get you a better deal—and it has worked on tens of millions of Americans for a decade.Read: The malignant cruelty of Donald TrumpThese conspiracy theories create communities that are hostile to dissenters, and they legitimize radical, even violent actions. This is how thousands of Trump supporters ended up ransacking the Capital on January 6, 2021, hoping to overturn an election on the basis of a conspiracy theory about voting machines, spread by elite figures who knew it to be false. The Dominion lawsuit against Fox News and the congressional inquiry into January 6 revealed that although much of the right-wing leadership class understand they have created a monster they cannot control, they lack the courage to confront it. Trump and his closest aides, by contrast, are well aware of the hold they have on their audience and see it as useful for their own purposes.“Before they seize power and establish a world according to their doctrines,” Hannah Arendt wrote, “totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which is more adequate to the needs of the human mind than reality itself; in which, through sheer imagination, uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations.” Trumpism is neither Nazism nor Stalinism, but Arendt’s observation about people living in a universe of complete unreality still applies.All of us navigate the world on the basis of information sources we trust, and millions of people trust Donald Trump. Understanding his longevity is perhaps impossible absent an information environment in which people come to passionately believe things that are not true. This is not a false-consciousness argument. If banning abortion matters more to you than raising the minimum wage, and you make your choice with that in mind, that is your right as a voter. But that decision should be based on values, not on a universe of unreality.The former president and his surrogates have woven a totalizing conspiracy theory in which virtually every problem facing the nation can be laid at the feet of immigration. Violent crime is rising because of immigrants (it isn’t). Democrats are chartering planes from other countries to bring in illegal immigrants (they aren’t), whom they are paying to come (it’s not happening) and who are smuggling in fentanyl (it’s overwhelmingly citizens who are doing the smuggling, actually), in the hopes that these illegal immigrants will vote for them (they can’t vote, and they wouldn’t necessarily vote for Democrats if they could). Immigrants are the main reason for the housing crisis (they aren’t—it’s a lack of supply); they’re getting FEMA money meant for citizens affected by the hurricanes in the South (wrong); and none of this would have happened if Biden and Harris hadn’t opened the border (the Biden administration is on pace to match Trump’s border deportations) to undocumented immigrants who don’t pay taxes (false). There really was a rise in illegal border crossings after the pandemic, but the response of the Democratic Party was to move closer to Trump’s positions on immigration.Nor will mass deportation, framed as a means to fight crime, resolve any of these issues. Mass deportation will not raise wages. It will not make housing less expensive. It will not create jobs. It will not make the welfare state more generous to those who need its assistance. And indeed, during Trump’s term as president, his administration shirked prosecuting undocumented criminals in favor of destroying families and removing as many people as possible, regardless of what roots they might have established. Trump aides are planning an attack on the kind of legal immigration that supporters at his rallies repeatedly told me they wanted—an attack that, if prior experience holds, will take precedence over enforcing the law against criminals.But for some today, just as in the past, the presence of immigrants threatens a “dominance” that, as Gordon wrote of the 1920s, “many white native-born Protestants considered a form of social property.” It is an odd but insufficient sign of progress that such status anxiety is no longer confined to white, Protestant, or native-born people—the irony is that America is such a powerful machine of assimilation that the ascendant reactionary coalition includes millions of people descended from those once deemed unassimilable aliens by their predecessors movements. Unfortunately, lies and conspiracy theories directed at those we see as unlike us are far more likely to be believed.Like Trump’s lies about voter fraud in 2020, the conspiracy theories about immigration are important not because there is truth to them but because they forge a political identity that is not amenable to fact-checking or correction. It does not matter if the “voter fraud” in 2020 did not happen; believing that it did expresses the symbolic view that the opposing coalition should not be considered truly American. To point out that very little of what Trump and his allies say about immigration is factual cannot dispel the worldview that causes one to embrace it: that the America you know has been stolen by people who have no claim to it.The workings of American immigration policy are complicated, though, and any sufficiently complicated process can appear to someone who doesn’t understand it as a conspiracy—if you don’t understand the weather, for example, you might think the U.S. government has a hurricane gun it can aim with pinpoint accuracy at Republican-majority districts. If you don’t understand something—and if understanding it might leave your conception of your own identity teetering, Jenga-like—it is much easier to believe what the people you love and trust are telling you, even if that thing is untrue.Perhaps most important, the breadth of the conspiracy and the power of the conspirators place any solutions beyond the reach of ordinary politics. At the rally prior to the storming of the Capitol, Trump warned the audience that “if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” Then he retreated to the safety of the White House and watched the mob attack Congress, hoping that by some miracle his supporters would succeed in keeping him in power by force. In such dire circumstances, only a messianic figure will rescue the virtuous from the corrupt. The logic of grand conspiracy thus elevates the strongman.In the conspiracist mind, Trump is not simply the only logical solution but the only hope, the only man not compromised by the grand cabal that opposes him and its puppet politicians. Trump’s followers are convinced that Trump’s wealth means he cannot be bought. Few politicians have ever been more clearly for sale.Doubtlessly, many liberals would deny a distinction between the devotion of Trump supporters who flock to his rallies and the ideological vanguard that aims to use him as a vehicle to remake the country. While I was out reporting this story, The Atlantic published an account of how, according to Trump’s former chief of staff General John Kelly, Trump spoke admiringly of Adolf Hitler and his generals. Typically, when I go out to rallies, I do not argue with voters or offer my own views, because I am there to find out what they believe and why. But because of my affiliation with The Atlantic, several people I spoke with asked me to explain my views—occasionally referring to the story as “fake news” or “Democrats calling Trump Hitler,” having heard the story wrongly characterized this way.In one exchange, I mentioned that as a man married to a woman born to a West African immigrant father, I did not appreciate Trump’s remarks about Black immigrants, and recounted the story of Trump complaining about not wanting immigrants from “shithole countries.” The Trump supporter had not heard of the 2018 incident and refused to believe that it had occurred as I relayed it.In two other conversations, when asked about my views, I explained that, as a Texan, if I choose to have another child, I have to worry that if something goes wrong, doctors may refuse to treat my wife because of the state’s abortion ban. Doctors in Texas are afraid to provide lifesaving medical care to mothers with pregnancy complications because the Republican-controlled state government has passed laws that punish abortion providers with steep fines, loss of their medical license, and jail time. The Texas courts have repeatedly refused to clarify or expand the exceptions to the ban—these exceptions are simply meant to ensure sufficient political support for those bans. Because of this, Texas parents have to roll the dice with a pregnancy, knowing that their existing children may end up without a mother.Not only did the people I spoke with react in disbelief that an abortion ban would be so strict; they did not believe that a doctor would refuse to treat a woman until she was at death’s door. Last week, ProPublica reported that a Texas mother, Josseli Barnica, died after doctors thought it would be a “crime” to treat her while she was having a miscarriage. ProPublica also reported that in 2023, a pregnant teenager from Vidor, Nevaeh Crain, died after three emergency rooms refused to treat her. Texas has fought the Biden administration’s attempt to set federal rules allowing emergency abortions. Last month, the Supreme Court let a ruling siding with Texas remain in place.Read: Gullible Mr. TrumpThere is a distance between the views of many of the most ardent Trump fans and the policy goals of the people they would put in power. The innermost MAGA circle understands this, even if many of the people whose votes they rely on don’t. This is why the role played by Fox News and other conservative media outlets is so crucial—not only in maintaining a sense of conspiracism and emotional siege but in ensuring that stories about women like Barnica and Crain never reach the eyes and ears of their audience.This is an observation, not an excuse. In a democracy, citizens are responsible for knowing the consequences of their votes. They are responsible for not being enthralled by a jumped-up con man who tells them flattering lies. They are responsible for knowing the difference between fact and fiction. And yet few of us would find it easy to extract ourselves from a social universe in which belief in those fictions is a requirement for good standing.Trump rallies are where the mask usually comes off. At the rallies, the different circles of MAGA lose their distinctiveness; in the anonymity and unity of the crowd, they can indulge the feelings of anger and hatred without the oversensitive, judgmental liberals of the outside world making them feel ashamed. Here, they can be themselves.This is why the insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe thought he was in the right place to call Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in late October. “These are the kind of jokes that normal people tell,” the conservative media figure Matt Walsh declared. Hinchcliffe was hardly an outlier. Other speakers that night called Harris a prostitute, “the anti-Christ,” “the devil.” The disgraced former Fox News host Tucker Carlson mocked Harris as “the first Samoan Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.”The big mistake made by Hinchcliffe was that, in wrestling parlance, he broke kayfabe. The Trump campaign has fine-tuned its line-stepping over the years, invoking racist stereotypes with just the thinnest veneer of deniability, the better to cast liberal criticism as hypersensitive hysteria. In 2016, Trump campaigned on banning Muslims writ large, not just jihadist terrorists. In 2020, he publicly vowed to meet the nationwide Black-rights protests with violence. In 2024, Trumpism remains a politics of bullying marginalized groups and framing those unwilling to do so as possessing a lack of virtue. Do you want to coddle murderous illegal aliens? Do you want men in women’s sports? Why are you okay with gangs taking over our cities?Trump’s agenda of using state power to maintain traditional American hierarchies of race, religion, and gender has not changed. But for much of his 2024 run, the sweeping generalizations of previous outings resembled more traditional dog whistling with superficially plausible connections to actual policy concerns. The shift can be imperceptible to people who have paid close attention to politics—Trump’s personality and ideology have not really changed—but to those who have not, his racial animus and misogyny are less obvious. About two-thirds of Hispanic voters in one recent poll said that Trump’s attacks on immigration were not directed at them.The rightward shift of some Hispanic and Black voters seems to have persuaded the Trump campaign to tone down the explicit racial stereotyping of his previous campaigns, though not the promises to use state power to crush his political enemies. But when you put a guy in front of a Trump campaign sign to warm up the crowd with hacky jokes about Black people liking watermelon, it gets harder to suspend disbelief.Amid the comedian’s insult to Puerto Rico and the barrage of racist stereotypes—not only about Black people and Puerto Ricans, but about Jews being cheap and Palestinians being terrorists—the word routine takes on another meaning: dull, tedious, boring. Yet the line about Puerto Rico broke through, and a growing list of Puerto Rican celebrities are now endorsing Harris, and perhaps moving crucial Hispanic votes in key swing states to her column.The crisis caused by Hinchcliffe’s routine and remarks by other speakers that night is that they troubled voters in that outer MAGA circle by briefly revealing what Trump’s entourage actually believes—that when Stephen Miller says “America is for Americans and Americans only,” he is referring to a very limited number of people. The event pierced the veil of denial for those who are otherwise inclined to dismiss such criticisms as the tedious whining of an oversensitive age.The Puerto Rican Reggaeton singer Nicky Jam renounced his support for Trump after the rally, saying, “Never in my life did I think that a month [after I appeared at a rally to support Trump] a comedian was going to come to criticize my country and speak badly of my country and therefore, I renounce any support for Donald Trump, and I sidestep any political situation.” Those people who renounced their support for Trump after realizing that the contempt he has expressed for others also applies to people like them must understand: He was always talking about people like you, even when you didn’t want to believe it.At Trump rallies, the denial and the dismissal cease, and the nature of Trumpism is revealed. This is why, despite the fact that the Puerto Rico “joke” bombed at a comedy club the night before, Hinchcliffe thought everyone at the rally would love it. His set was not a divergence from Trumpism. It was … Well, it was routine.More StoriesTrumpists Don’t Seem to Mind Claims of Sexual AssaultThe Trump-Trumpist Divide

Deportation is a power of the presidency: Trump can indeed do all of this if he is determined to.Trump has pledged huge increases in U.S. tariffs, not only on China but on friends and treaty partners, such as Mexico. Congress has historically delegated the president’s broad authority over trade. A restored President Trump will have the power to impose tariffs, and will also have the power to exempt industries and firms that bid for his favor.Trump intends to shut down legal proceedings, state and federal, against himself. A friendly Supreme Court appears to grant him wide leeway to do so. He has promised to pardon people serving sentences for the attack on Congress on January 6, 2021. The president has the power to do that also. He has spoken of prosecuting people who donate to Democratic candidates and of retribution against media companies that criticize him. Although it’s uncertain how far the courts would let him succeed, Trump is seeking a stooge attorney general who will at least try to bring such prosecutions.Trump ordered his allies in Congress to oppose further military aid to Ukraine and got his way for six deadly months. Trump chose as his running mate one of the GOP’s harshest critics of the Ukrainian cause. Trump boasts that he will end the fighting within weeks. That is code for forcing Ukraine to submit to Russia.One of Trump’s former national security advisers, John Bolton, predicts that Trump would withdraw from NATO in a second term. Trump does not have to withdraw formally, however. NATO ultimately depends on the U.S. president’s commitment to upholding the treaty’s mutual-defense clause and assisting threatened NATO members. As president, all Trump has to do to kill NATO is repeat what he once said as a candidate: that unless they pay up, he won’t protect this or that ally from attack. No further action required; the deed is done.Some Trump apologists put a gloss on his pro–Vladimir Putin instincts by arguing that abandoning Ukraine will somehow strengthen the U.S. against China. Really? China will be impressed by a United States that walked away from Ukraine’s successful war of self-defense against Russian aggression because the American president is infatuated with the Russian dictator?Whatever theory Trump allies may confect, Trump himself made it clear in a July interview that Taiwan cannot count on him any more than Ukraine can. Trump conceives of the U.S. alliance system as a protection racket, not as an association of democracies. In his preelection interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan, Trump made the Mafia comparison explicit. He said of Taiwan and other allies: “They want us to protect, and they want protection. They don’t pay us money for the protection, you know? The mob makes you pay money, right?” A vote for Trump isn’t a vote for some Pacific-first strategy, however misconceived or addled. It’s a vote for international gangsterism. Trump feels most at home with dictators (including Xi Jinping, China’s president for life) and with client states, such as Saudi Arabia, that pay emoluments to him and to his family via their businesses.Yet a second-term Trump will not travel a smooth path to autocracy at home and isolation from abroad. If Trump does return to the presidency, it will almost certainly occur after a third consecutive loss of the popular vote: by 3 million in 2016, 7 million in 2020, and who knows how many millions in 2024.Since the end of the Cold War, a Republican candidate for president has won more votes than his Democratic counterpart exactly once, in 2004. Even so, the GOP has enjoyed three presidencies, and soon perhaps a fourth. Minority rule begins to look like not merely a feature of Republican administration, but actually a precondition for it. Trump Republicans may now insist, “We’re a republic, not a democracy.” But most Americans assumed that we were a democracy—and believe that, to the extent we’re not, we should be.If a president who comes to office without a majority democratic mandate starts doing the radical things Trump wants to do—building detention camps, pardoning January 6 culprits, abandoning Ukraine—he’s going to find himself on the receiving end of some powerful opposition. A president hoisted into office by a glitch of the Electoral College cannot silence criticism by invoking his popular mandate. A president who has been convicted of felonies and who fires prosecutors in order to save himself from being convicted of even more is not well positioned to demand law and order.Trump may forget, but his opponents will not, that he was the man who wrecked the country’s centuries-long record of a peaceful transition of power. That particular clock reset itself to zero in 2021. The American tradition is now shorter than those of Moldova and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, both of which have a record of peaceful transition of power stretching all the way back to 2019.A second Trump administration will be even more of a snake pit of craziness, incompetence, and intrigue than the first was. Elon Musk will imagine himself to be the real power in the land: After all, he bought the presidency, didn’t he? Vice President J. D. Vance will scheme to shoulder aside an elderly Trump, whom he never respected. It’s amazing what a vice president can get done if he arrives at the office at six in the morning and the president doesn’t show up until nearly noon. The lower levels of the administration will see a nonstop guerrilla war between the opportunists who signed up with Trump for their own advantage and the genuine crackpots.From the viewpoint of millions of Americans, a second Trump presidency would be the result of a foreign cabal’s exploitation of defects in the constitutional structure to impose un-American authoritarianism on an unwilling majority. It enrages pro-Trump America that anti-Trump America regards Trump and Vance as disloyal tools of Russian subversion—but we do, we have the evidence, and we have the numbers.If Trump is elected again, world trade will contract under the squeeze of U.S. protectionism. Prices will jump for ordinary Americans. Farmers and other exporters will lose markets. Businesses will lose competitiveness as Trump tariffs raise the price of every input in the supply chain, including such basic commodities as steel and such advanced products as semiconductor chips.As Americans quarrel over Trump’s extreme actions, the most prominent predators—Russia, China, and Iran—will prowl, seeking advantage for themselves in the U.S. turmoil. Ominously, Trump’s weakness may make great-power conflict more likely.Putin, Xi, and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un may imagine that because they can manipulate and outwit Trump, they can discount the United States entirely. China especially may misinterpret Trump’s dislike of allies as an invitation to grab Taiwan—only to trigger a U.S. reaction that may surprise China and Trump alike. Until such a desperate moment, however, former allies will look elsewhere for protection. As a French cabinet minister said, only days ago: “We cannot leave the security of Europe in the hands of the voters of Wisconsin every four years.”Under a returned President Trump, the American century will come to a close, in the way darkly foreseen by a great 20th-century novel of Washington power, Allen Drury’s Advise and Consent, from 1959:In his lifetime he had seen America rise and rise and rise, some sort of golden legend to her own people, some sort of impossible fantasy to others … rise and rise and rise—and then … the golden legend crumbled, overnight the fall began, the heart went out of it.McKay Coppins: This is not the end of AmericaTrump’s ascent has driven many to wonder how U.S. politics became so polarized, so extreme. That question, so often repeated, is also profoundly misplaced. We all regularly encounter fellow Americans who hold views different from our own. Almost all of those encounters unfold with calm and civility.The speech and behavior modeled by Trump are emulated by only his most fervent admirers, and even then only in safe spaces, such as on social media and at his rallies. The most pro-Trump employer in America would instantly fire any employee who talked about women, racial minorities, international partners, or people who lived in big cities the way that Trump does. An employee who told lies, shifted blame, exulted in violence, misappropriated other people’s property, blathered nonsense, or just wandered around vacantly as Trump does would be referred to mental-health professionals or reported to law enforcement.Trump’s conduct is in fact so disturbing and offensive even to his supporters that they typically cope either by denying attested facts or by inventing fictional good deeds and falsely attributing them to him: secret acts of charity, empathy, or courtesy that never happened.Trump’s political superpower has not been his ability to activate a small fan base. If that’s all he were able to do, he’d be no more a threat to American institutions than any of the other fanatics and oddballs who lurk on the edges of mainstream politics. Trump’s superpower has been his ability to leverage his sway over a cult following to capture control of one of the two great parties in U.S. politics. If all we had to worry about were the people who idolize Trump, we would not have much to worry about. Unfortunately, we also must worry about the people who see him as he is but choose to work through him anyway, in pursuit of their own goals.For that reason, Trump’s rise has imposed a special responsibility upon those of us with backgrounds in conservative and Republican politics. He arose because he was enabled not just by people we knew but by people we also knew to despise him.For that reason too, his rise has generated a fierce and determined internal refusal of a kind not seen before in presidential politics. “Never Trump” is both a label for the reaction of some of the most prominent Republicans, such as Mitt Romney and Dick Cheney, and a movement that has helped tip into the Democratic column congressional seats once held by George H. W. Bush, Newt Gingrich, Eric Cantor, and many other former party stalwarts. These did not use to be “swing seats” by any definition: Bush’s seat had been Republican-held for more than half a century until it went Democratic in 2018. Through the 2024 primaries, about one-fifth of Republicans voted against Trump to the very end, even after all of his opponents ended their campaigns.Pro-Trump Republicans dismiss this internal refusal as unimportant. They also rage against the refusers as party traitors. I have felt that fury because I number among the refusers.About two weeks ago, I received an email from a reader who demanded, not very politely, that I cease describing myself as a conservative if I did not support Trump’s return to the presidency:I know a lot of you NeverTrumpers want to pretend otherwise, but the Trump presidency was a very conservative presidency, and a lot of policy objectives of the Conservative Movement were achieved in his presidency … There is never a conservative case for voting for a Democrat over a Republican due to the simple fact that in any given election (whether its federal or state or local), the Republican candidate is to the right of the Democratic candidate.One lesson of the Trump years, however, is about how old concepts of “right” and “left” have fallen out of date in the Trump era. What was conservatism once? A politics of gratitude for America’s great constitutional traditions, a politics of free markets and free trade, a politics of American global leadership. This was the politics that excited me, as a very young man, to knock on doors for the Reagan-Bush ticket in the election of 1980.Ronald Reagan liked to describe the United States as a “shining city on a hill.” As Trump closed his 2024 campaign, he derided the country as “the garbage can for the world.” In his first inaugural address, Reagan challenged the country “to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds.” He concluded: “And after all, why shouldn’t we believe that? We are Americans.” Trump instead condemns the United States as a “stupid country that’s run by stupid people.”In 1987, Reagan traveled to Berlin, then still divided by the Iron Curtain, to urge the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall.” Three years later, Trump gave an interview to Playboy in which he condemned Gorbachev for not crushing dissent more harshly and praised the Chinese Communist Party for the murderous violence of Tiananmen Square:When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength … Russia is out of control, and the leadership knows it. That’s my problem with Gorbachev. Not a firm enough hand.Reagan saluted a common American identity bigger than party. In 1982, he honored the centenary of the birth of his great opposite number among 20th-century presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt:Like the Founding Fathers before him, F.D.R. was an American giant, a leader who shaped, inspired, and led our people through perilous times. He meant many different things to many different people. He could reach out to men and women of diverse races and backgrounds and inspire them with new hope and new confidence in war and peace.Forty-two years later, Donald Trump describes his Democratic adversaries, including the most recent Democratic speaker of the House, as enemies “from within.” Trump also mused about using the National Guard and the U.S. military against “the enemy within.” He has repeatedly spoken of using state power to retaliate against politicians and journalists. As president, he pressed his attorney general to prosecute his critics and perceived adversaries. Privately, he often spoke and speaks of arresting and executing opponents, including General Mark Milley, the most senior member of the military who incurred his displeasure. He has endorsed proposals to haul former Republican Representative Liz Cheney before a military tribunal to be punished for voting for his impeachment.Even if Trump is only partly successful in crushing dissent, the authoritarian direction in which he wishes to lead the country is unmistakable. Since 2021, Trump has bent the Republican Party to his will even more radically now than he did as president. Republicans have made their peace with Trump’s actions on January 6. They wrote tariffs into their 2024 party platform. They let Trump plunder party funds for his own legal defense, and then, because they were broke, turned over their get-out-the-vote operation to Elon Musk’s personal super PAC. The Republican Party has lost its immunity to Trump’s authoritarianism.Trump himself has only become more vengeful and bloodthirsty. He told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2021 about his response to two impeachments: “I became worse.” This personal instinct will guide the entire administration, and that is the meaning of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which functions as Trump’s first-year operating plan (in part because Project 2025 is the only plan Trump’s got).If you are inclined to vote for Trump out of some attachment to a Reaganite idea of conservative Republicanism, think again. Your party, the party that stood for freedom against the Berlin Wall, has three times nominated a man who praised the massacre at Tiananmen Square.Forty years is a long time in politics. The four decades from 1924 to 1964 saw the Democratic Party evolve from one that nominated a segregationist and refused to condemn the Ku Klux Klan to the party that wrote and implemented the Civil Rights Act. Over a similar interval, the Republican Party has rotated from being one of freedom and enterprise to one of authoritarianism and repression. Yet many inside the Republican world and outside—including my email correspondent—insist on pretending that nothing has changed.A few weeks ago, a researcher released a report that tallied political contributions by almost 100,000 executives and corporate directors at almost 10,000 firms from 2001 to 2022. The tally showed a pronounced trend away from Republican candidates and conservative causes. When reported in the media, the headlines pronounced that “CEOs Are Moving Left.” Are they? Or are they instead recognizing that the party of Trump and Vance has become virtually the opposite of the party of Reagan and Bush?Consider this example: In his 1991 State of the Union address, Bush discerned an “opportunity to fulfill the long-held promise of a new world order, where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance.” Campaigning this year, Vance appeared at the Turning Point USA convention alongside the far-right broadcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who announced: “We’re bringing down the new world order!”Trump is opposed by almost every member of his first-term national-security team, and by his own former vice president; he has the support of the anti-vax crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the propagandist for Russian imperialism Tulsi Gabbard. Something revolutionary has happened inside the Republican Party: If you placed your faith and loyalty in Reagan and Bush’s party of freedom, you need to accept that the party of Trump and Vance has rejected your ideals, discarded your heroes, defiled your most cherished political memories. This GOP is something new and different and ugly, and you owe it nothing.Read: The Democratic theory of winning with less“I believe in america.” Those words open a great American movie, The Godfather. Although, in the film, those words pulse with heavy irony—they are spoken by an undertaker to a gangster as they together plot an act of revenge against a bigoted failure of American justice—they also pulse with power. We can recognize that there is so much to doubt about America, yet we believe in it all the same.In 1860, Americans voted on whether to remain one country or to split over slavery. In 1964, Americans voted on whether to defend equal rights before the law. So also will the election of 2024 turn on one ultimate question: whether to protect our constitutional democracy or submit to a presidency that wants to reorder the United States in such a way that it will become one of the world’s reactionary authoritarian regimes.Some rationalizers for Trump want to deceive you that you face an unhappy choice between two equally difficult extremes. That is untrue. One choice, the Trump choice, deviates from the path of constitutional democracy toward a murky and sinister future. The other choice allows the United States to continue its cautious progress along the lines marked by the Declaration of Independence and the Fourteenth Amendment toward the aspiration of a “more perfect union.”If elected, Kamala Harris will be the first woman president: a dramatic breakthrough in U.S. history. Yet, in so many ways, her presidency will be constrained. She’ll almost certainly face a Republican-controlled Senate from the start; very possibly, a Republican House, too. Even if the Democrats somehow win a majority in a single chamber of Congress in 2024, they’ll almost certainly lose it in 2026. Besides a hostile Congress, she would also face adverse courts and a media environment in which a handful of ultra-wealthy owners can impose ever-stricter limits on what may be said and who will hear it.Yet within these inevitable limitations, Harris offers one big idea: the equal right of the female half of the American people to freedom and individuality.Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, American women have become the targets of a campaign of surveillance, policing, and control. In many places, they have lost the right to protect themselves from the consequences of sexual violence. A study in an American Medical Association journal estimates that some 65,000 rape-caused pregnancies a year are occurring in the 14 states where abortion is now banned. State governments have inserted themselves into the medical care of women who miscarry their pregnancies, restricting the treatment their doctors can offer—sometimes with permanent loss of fertility or worse as a result of the government’s order.Some conservative states are weighing restrictions on the right of pregnant women to travel across state lines to seek abortions in more liberal jurisdictions. In a 2022 interview, Vance declared himself sympathetic to such authoritarian measures:I’m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here’s a situation—let’s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let’s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity—that’s kind of creepy … And it’s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?In his 1960 book, The Conscience of a Conservative, Senator Barry Goldwater answered those who asked what he, as president, would do about this or that particular constituent interest. His words echo to this day: “I shall reply that I was informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can.”America’s main interest remains liberty. The election of 2024 will sway federal policy on a huge range of issues: climate change; economic growth; border security; stability on the European continent, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific. Supreme above all of these issues, however, is preserving the right of the American people to govern themselves according to their constitutional rules.Trump is not an abstract thinker. When he thinks about the presidency, he thinks about enriching himself, flattering his ego, and punishing his enemies. Yet, as he pursues his impulsive purposes, he is also advancing a bigger cause in which he has many more intelligent partners, and one that will outlast his political career. That cause is to rearrange the U.S. government so that a minority can indefinitely rule over the American majority.As hemmed in as her presidency may be, Harris will also have a great cause to advance. Her cause will be what Lincoln’s was, and Roosevelt’s, and Reagan’s, too: to protect the right of the American majority to govern itself in defiance of domestic plutocrats and foreign autocrats. Every domestic-policy challenge—climate change, economic growth, budget deficits, border security—will follow from this prior question: “Government of the people, by the people, for the people—or government of some people, by some people, for some people?”Voting has begun. This great ritual of American democracy reaches its climax on November 5. The right vote to cast in 2024 is both progressive and conservative: conservative because it conserves the great things Americans have already done together and progressive because it keeps alive the possibility of doing still greater things in the future. The near-term policy outlook matters far less than stopping a small cabal of sinister and suspect power-seekers from blocking forever the right of the American majority to do any great things at all.In the immediate shock of Trump’s inauguration in 2017, I posted these words:We are living through the most dangerous challenge to the free government of the United States that anyone alive has encountered. What happens next is up to you and me. Don’t be afraid. This moment of danger can also be your finest hour as a citizen and an American.Over the succeeding four years of Trump’s term, I lived almost every day in a state of dread. Perhaps you did, too. Yet the American people proved equal to the work required of them. The guardrails shook, and in some places they cracked, yet when the ultimate test came, in January 2021, brave Americans of both great parties joined to beat back Trump’s violent attempted seizure of power.Now here we are again. You are needed once more. Perhaps you feel wearier than you did seven years ago. Perhaps you feel more afraid today than you did then. Yet you must still find the strength to answer your country’s call. You can do it. We can do it. We believe in America.More StoriesA Constitutional Crisis Greater Than WatergateA Good Country’s Bad Choice

CONTENT: Conversations about politics are inevitable this holiday.How to survive political talk at the Thanksgiving dinner tableIt’s Thanksgiving, you’re enjoying your favorite foods at the dinner table, when a family member brings up who they voted for in the 2024 presidential election.Arguments ensue.The food doesn’t taste as good.And now everyone’s a politician.In a contentious election year, conversations about politics at the dinner table are inevitable.But Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert, has some tips on how to best handle these conversations this Thanksgiving.“One of the things that I recommend for any host to do is set aside time and or space for people to talk politics,” Swann told ABC News. “This means you set the rules and you tell folks, listen, when you come here, here’s when we’re going to talk politics.”Swann suggests chatting about the election is done before or after dinner. And move people to a different room for dessert to express themselves, she said.Although talking politics is normally discouraged in settings like this, Swann said she believes people are really passionate about the past election. She wants these conversations to bring people together rather than drive them apart.“It’s important for us to have these conversations in order to bring folks together,” she said. “But keep in mind, the purpose is not to convince one person of anything. It’s also to bring the family together and help people understand your own perspective and views.”Swann encourages everyone to follow her three core values of etiquette, which are respect, honesty and consideration. She also said “to let folks know, look, you’ve got one chance, two chances, or three chances, and then you’re out.”If conversations are getting a bit out of hand, Swann recommends changing the subject. In addition, she said to have a slideshow of family photos displayed on the TV or have a mediator to instill some control in these conversations.Finally, Swann asks hosts to “bring that holiday vibe into their homes.”“As a host, be present, be aware and also be an advocate for those who feel like they're being beat up on,” Swann said.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

CONTENT: President-elect Donald Trump is filling key posts in his second administration, and it’s shaping up much differently than his first. He’s prioritizing loyalists for top jobs.Trump was bruised and hampered by internal squabbles during his initial term in office. Now he appears focused on remaking the federal government in his own image. Some of his choices could face difficult confirmation battles even with Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate.Here’s a look at whom he has selected so far.Trump named Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to be secretary of state, making the critic-turned-ally his choice for top diplomat.Rubio, 53, is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate on the Republican ticket last summer. Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The announcement punctuates the hard pivot Rubio has made with Trump, whom the senator once called a “con man” during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.Their relationship improved dramatically while Trump was in the White House. And as Trump campaigned for the presidency a third time, Rubio cheered his proposals. For instance, Rubio, who more than a decade ago helped craft immigration legislation that included a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally, now supports Trump’s plan to use the U.S. military for mass deportations.Trump said Wednesday he will nominate Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as his attorney general, naming a loyalist in the role of the nation’s top prosecutor.In selecting Gaetz, 42, Trump passed over more established lawyers whose names had been mentioned as being contenders for the job.“Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and Restore Americans’ badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,” Trump said in a statement.Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced him. The House Ethics Committee has been investigating an allegation that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old, though that probe effectively ended when he resigned. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by Trump to be director of national intelligence, another example of Trump prizing loyalty over experience.Gabbard, 43, was a Democratic House member who unsuccessfully sought the party’s 2020 presidential nomination before leaving the party in 2022. She endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him this fall, and she’s been accused of echoing Russian propaganda.Gabbard, who has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait, would come to the role as an outsider compared to her predecessor. The current director, Avril Haines, was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in a number of top national security and intelligence positions.Hegseth, 44, was a co-host of Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends Weekend” and has been a contributor with the network since 2014. He developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show.Hegseth served in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2021, deploying to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2011. He has two Bronze Stars. However, Hegseth lacks senior military and national security experience. If confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit the top job during a series of global crises — ranging from Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies to the push for a cease-fire between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea.Hegseth is also the author of “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,” published earlier this year.Lutnick heads up the brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and is a cryptocurrency enthusiast. He is co-chair of Trump’s transition operation, charged along with Linda McMahon, a former wrestling executive who previously led Trump’s Small Business Administration, with helping the president-elect build a Cabinet for his second administration.As commerce secretary, Lutnick would play a key role in carrying out Trump’s plans to raise and enforce tariffs. He would oversee a sprawling Cabinet department whose oversight ranges from funding new computer chip factories and imposing trade restrictions to releasing economic data and monitoring the weather.Noem is a well-known conservative who used her two terms as South Dakota’s governor to vault to a prominent position in Republican politics.During the COVID-19 pandemic, Noem did not order restrictions that other states had issued and instead declared her state “open for business.” Trump held a fireworks rally at Mount Rushmore in July 2020 in one of the first large gatherings of the pandemic.More recently, Noem faced sharp criticism for telling a story in her memoir about shooting and killing her dog.She is set to lead a department crucial to the president-elect’s hardline immigration agenda as well as other missions. Homeland Security oversees natural disaster response, the U.S. Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration agents who work at airports.Ratcliffe, a former U.S. House member from Texas, was director of national intelligence during the final year and a half of Trump’s first term, leading the U.S. government’s spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.If confirmed, Ratcliffe will have held the highest intelligence positions in the U.S.Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat, then as an independent, and then endorsed Trump. He’s the son of Democratic icon Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated during his own presidential campaign.The nomination alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. For example, he has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism.Duffy is a former House member from Wisconsin who was one of Trump’s most visible defenders on cable news. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, sitting on the Financial Services Committee and chairing the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019 for a TV career and has been the host of “The Bottom Line” on Fox Business.Before entering politics, Duffy was a reality TV star on MTV, where he met his wife, “Fox and Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy. They have nine children.Collins is a former Republican congressman from Georgia who gained recognition for defending Trump during his first impeachment trial, which centered on U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump was impeached for urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in 2019 during the Democratic presidential nomination, but he was acquitted by the Senate.Collins has also served in the armed forces himself and is currently a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command.The governor of North Dakota, once little-known outside his state, is a former Republican presidential primary contender who endorsed Trump and then spent months traveling to drum up support for Trump after dropping out of the race.Burgum was a serious contender to be Trump’s vice presidential choice this summer. The two-term governor was seen as a possible pick because of his executive experience and business savvy. Burgum also has close ties to deep-pocketed energy industry CEOs.Trump initially announced his choice of Burgum while addressing a gala at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His formal announcement the following day said he wanted Burgum to be Interior secretary and chairman of a new National Energy Council. Burgun will also have a seat on the National Security Council, which would be a first for the Interior secretary.A campaign donor and CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Write is a vocal advocate of oil and gas development, including fracking — a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.Wright also has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” The Energy Department is responsible for advancing energy, environmental and nuclear security of the United States.Wright also won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term.McMahon, a billionaire professional wrestling mogul, would be making a return appearance in a second Trump administration. She led the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019 during Trump’s initial term and twice ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut. She served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009 and has spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. She has expressed support for charter schools and school choice.Zeldin does not appear to have any experience in environmental issues, but is a longtime supporter of the former president. The 44-year-old former U.S. House member from New York wrote on X, “We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.”“We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,” he added.During his campaign, Trump often attacked the Biden administration’s promotion of electric vehicles, and incorrectly referred to a tax credit for EV purchases as a government mandate. Trump also often told his audiences during the campaign that his administration would “drill, baby, drill,” referring to his support for expanded petroleum exploration.Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager.She has a background in Florida politics, helping Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump’s defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary.Wiles’ hire was Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with him. Wiles is said to have earned Trump’s trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump’s three presidential campaigns.Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.Waltz is a three-term Republican congressman from east-central Florida. A former Army Green Beret, he served multiple tours in Afghanistan and also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs.He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump’s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation’s history.He led the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Trump’s first administration and said at a conference over the summer that he would be willing to “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”Democrats have criticized Homan for defending Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump’s priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump’s first administration.Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump’s policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families. Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation’s economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally.Scavino was an adviser in all three of the president-elect’s campaigns, and the transition team referred to him as one of “Trump’s longest serving and most trusted aides.” He will be deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president. He previously ran Trump’s social media profile in the White House during his first administration.Blair was political director for Trump’s 2024 campaign and for the Republican National Committee. He will be deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs and assistant to the president. Blair was key to Trump’s economic messaging during his winning White House comeback campaign.Budowich is a veteran Trump campaign aide who launched and directed Make America Great Again, Inc., a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 campaign. He will be deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel and assistant to the president.Leavitt, 27, was Trump’s campaign press secretary and currently a spokesperson for his transition. She would be the youngest White House press secretary in history.Leavitt worked in the White House press office during Trump’s first term.In 2022, she ran for Congress in New Hampshire, winning a 10-way Republican primary before losing to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas.McGinley was White House Cabinet secretary during Trump’s first administration, and was outside legal counsel for the Republican National Committee’s election integrity effort during the 2024 campaign.The 67-year-old Witkoff is the president-elect’s golf partner and was golfing with him at Trump’s club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15, when the former president was the target of a second attempted assassination.Trump also named Witkoff co-chair, with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, of his inaugural committee.Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and his intended nomination comes as Trump has promised to align U.S. foreign policy more closely with Israel’s interests as it wages wars against the Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.Huckabee, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016, has been a popular figure among evangelical Christian conservatives, many of whom support Israel due to Old Testament writings that Jews are God’s chosen people and that Israel is their rightful homeland.Huckabee has rejected a Palestinian homeland in territory occupied by Israel, calling for a so-called “one-state solution.”Stefanik is a U.S. representative from New York and one of Trump’s staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.Stefanik’s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.Oz, 64, is a former heart surgeon who hosted “The Dr. Oz Show,” a long-running daytime television talk show. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 2022 and is an outspoken supporter of Trump, who endorsed Oz’s bid for elected office.

CONTENT: Top pollster Nate Silver has said that 2024 was "a reasonable year" for the polling industry, saying that "messy" politics damaged public opinion of the practice.Silver, who published his election prediction model on the Silver Bulletin Substack, said that the final polling averages for the 2024 election were accurate for the majority of the states despite a feeling of uncertainty throughout the race about who was ahead.Writing in a New York Times op-ed, Silver said: "It may even feel as though we're Ping-Ponging between radically different futures, never quite certain what lies around the bend."Yet on the whole in 2024, polling did not experience much of a miss and had a reasonable year. Ms. Harris led by only one point in my final national polling average. And Donald Trump led in five of seven key states, albeit incredibly narrowly. The final polling averages were correct in 48 of 50 states."In the lead-up to the presidential election, most prediction models had President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in a dead heat. The result, a decisive Trump victory in which he swept every swing state, led many to criticize the polling industry for being unable to predict the victory.However, Silver posited that polling reflects a divided electorate, saying that the uncertainty was part of the current political climate."In a world where the parties are remarkably efficient at corralling voters and competing to a 50-50 split each time, polls aren't going to provide the certainty we crave," Silver wrote."We'd better get used to it: This is now the fourth election in a row in which the popular vote margin was within five points, something that has happened only once before in the country's history, for six elections between 1876 through 1896."The problems with polls are the same problems that plague politics. Polling has become a mirror that reflects the frustrating, even infuriating, nature of politics in America in 2024. Our politics are messy, and that is not something polls can fix. We'd better get used to that, too."Silver's prediction for the election was that the race was a "pure toss-up.""When I say the odds in this year's presidential race are about as close as you can possibly get to 50/50, I'm not exaggerating," he wrote in his newsletter.He also predicted a high chance of a "clean sweep" on election night, with one of the candidates winning every swing state—a prediction that proved to be accurate.According to Silver's forecast, there was a 20 percent likelihood of Trump winning every swing state and a 14 percent chance of Harris winning every swing state.Do you have a story we should be covering?

CONTENT: This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.Publicly, Joe Biden never wavered. Privately, those close to him believed that the President would eventually intervene and end the federal prosecutions against his son.Sunday evening’s surprise announcement of a sweeping pardon for Hunter Biden sent Washington ablaze with outrage. Talk turned to what this about-face would mean for the President’s legacy, the impact it might have on the Justice Department’s already battered credibility, and whether President-elect Donald Trump, himself a convicted felon, would accept the pardon as the final word. It all felt very loud, very urgent—and, to some, very predictable.Yet, when you take a look at Biden’s choice—making use of a power guaranteed in the Constitution with very few limits—it starts to make some sense. Yes, Biden flip-flopped on a pretty absolute pledge not to exercise the right to spare his son. Yes, it flies in the face of Democrats’ long-standing criticism about Trump, that no one should be above the law regardless of ties to the Oval Office. And, yes, this is going to dog Biden’s final weeks in office in ways that could distract from his urgent work to build a legacy after a half-century in public life.But all those criticisms ignore a bigger truth: Joe Biden faced a trickier decision than whether or not to keep his only living son out of prison. Many will ding it as an entirely selfish move by a guilty father going with his gut. Yet, in a way, this was maybe the most considered decision Biden has made this calendar year—and that includes the jarring announcement in July that he would step aside as the Democratic Party’s nominee.Here are the six factors that explain why Biden signed the roughly 200-word order:For years, Hunter Biden and his work for a Ukrainian energy company has been catnip for conservatives—many of whom still believe that the money paid to Hunter for his work on the Burisma board was a bag of cash for the Bidens, with Joe Biden skimming a share from the top. (So much of the GOP case against the Bidens has been debunked and their efforts to impeach Joe Biden fell apart.) With Trump about to be back in charge of the Justice Department and FBI—including an FBI potentially led by an outspoken loyalist who has endorsed Trump’s vow to trample his foes in retribution—there was a quiet fear that the President-elect would make hunting Hunter Biden’s misdeeds a priority—even if Hunter Biden was already serving out a prison sentence. Joe Biden’s signature on an extraordinarily broad pardon rendered those efforts pointless, as no federal charges can be summoned.There is no point disputing this. Most experts conclude that for anyone else facing these charges, the cases would have been likely handled with an in-and-out plea deal, one that was once on the table but rejected by a Trump-appointed judge for its novel sweep. The prosecution became even more novel once the Trump-nominated U.S. Attorney for Delaware won special counsel standing for the Hunter Biden case. With protected standing, Special Counsel David Weiss continued down a path that yielded convictions on three federal felony counts for illegally buying a gun and nine guilty pleas on federal tax charges. Hunter Biden was due to be sentenced on the gun conviction on Dec. 12, followed by a Dec. 16 sentencing on the tax evasion plea. If given the maximum penalties—considered unlikely—he would have faced up to 42 years in prison.Yes, Joe Biden flip-flopped with zero apology. Yes, he was running around the world—literally—telling everyone the justice system worked for both his son and his rival, Trump. Yes, he would take guff from some of the same folks whose approval Biden has chased for decades. But voters rendered their verdict on Biden’s by-the-books approach when they chose to return Trump to power. Heck, Trump repeatedly floated mass pardons for those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress. Voters decided that was appealing—or at least not disqualifying—and chose to give Trump the keys again.If Trump seems to think waving the magic wand of legal do-overs comes with zero costs to him, maybe Biden is rightly betting that he enjoys similar leeway. After all, Trump’s first term included freebies for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, and “junk-bond king” Michael Milken. He also employed his leniency power to spare five staffers and advisers, three uniformed service members accused of war crimes, seven disgraced former members of Congress—all Republicans—and 10 health care providers accused in a massive Medicare fraud scheme.Given that recent history, imagine if Hunter Biden’s mid-December sentencing included years in prison—for transgressions that experts say are rarely prosecuted. What would the public reaction have been if Joe Biden, in the final days of his presidency, refused to use a get-out-of-jail-free card for his very own son? Joe Biden spent his half-century in politics insisting that politics had no place in the judicial system, but that belief ran head-first into a competing precept that family stands above all other concerns. The President’s grief over the death of his son Beau Biden has been the overlay of so much of the Biden family’s decision-making in the last decade, and surely factored into the President’s thinking as he weighed the prospect of even more his grandkids spending time without their own father. It was a politically fraught move, but not an unexpected one. After all, when an Iowan asked Biden about Hunter’s work in Ukraine back in December of 2019, the then-former VP called the man “a damned liar” and challenged him to a push-up contest. Joe Biden followed-up with a pledge to keep his own house in order if elected.And not for nothing, Hunter Biden has been incredibly open about his battles with addiction, and has seemingly turned around his life in the years after some admittedly poor choices. A lengthy jail term would do little to teach Hunter Biden any lessons he hasn’t already internalized. That argument appeared to help Joe Biden get to yes.  The pardon power is absolute and the President’s alone. There’s no sign off needed from Congress and no one in his administration has any real authority to stop him. That’s why, when Biden said “I will not pardon him” on June 13, some were skeptical. A pardon was always an option, no matter how much his aides and allies urged otherwise on All Things Hunt. How else to explain why Joe Biden welcomed Hunter Biden to a state dinner just days after the younger Biden cut a doomed deal with federal prosecutors, led by an Attorney General attending the same event? Despite Hunter Biden’s ghosts, he still has sway inside his father’s inner circle as the eldest living child of a once-imagined political dynasty.The White House released the news late Sunday, just as Biden was about to hop on a flight heading out on his final foreign trip as President. That puts the President out of Washington until Thursday with no formal press conference on the books, a strategy that follows a South America trip last month that came with a similar media brown-out. That leaves a whole lot of time to fill in a Washington subsumed by this apparent violation of Biden’s vow not to do what he just did. And, aboard the presidential flight on Air Force One, the White House’s top spokeswoman doubled-down on the reversal. And on Monday, as she welcomed National Guard members to the White House to tour the holiday decorations, First Lady Jill Biden got pelted with a question about the pardon. "Of course I support the pardon of my son," Dr. Biden said in the White House’s State Dining Room.On top of that, Washington faces its seemingly auto-renewal gift of a holiday-themed spending deadline; this year, Congress has until Dec. 20 to kick the can down the road, and there’s a whole lot of disagreement just how far into Trump’s second term they should be looking toward. Put simply: the pardon is not going to stay front of mind for most Americans, and Trump is likely to find a way to hijack the public discourse as Team Joe runs down the clock.Make sense of what matters in Washington.

CONTENT: Donald Trump will return to Washington flanked by an entourage intent on imposing its archaic vision of gender politics on the nation.Listen to more stories on HarkThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.throughout american political history, two capable, qualified, experienced women have run for president on a major-party ticket. Both have lost to Donald Trump, perhaps the most famous misogynist ever to reach the highest office. But in 2024, what was even more alarming than in 2016 was how Trump’s campaign seemed to be promoting a version of the country in which men dominate public life, while women are mostly confined to the home, deprived of a voice, and neutralized as a threat to men’s status and ambitions.Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.This time around, I wasn’t hopeful. I didn’t let myself entertain any quixotic notions about what having a woman in the most powerful position in the world might mean for our status and sense of self. I simply wished for voters to reject the idea, pushed so fervently by those on Trump’s side, that women should be subservient incubators, passively raising the next generation of men who disdain them. This wish did not pan out. “Your body, my choice. Forever,” the white-supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes, who has dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, posted on X on Election Night. “Women threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,” the right-wing troll Jon Miller wrote on the same site.Read: The end of American romanceFor Trump, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion was apparently only the beginning. Bolstered by that definitive Supreme Court win and flanked by a hateful entourage intent on imposing its archaic vision of gender politics on the nation, the Trump-Vance ticket seemed to outright reject ideas of women’s autonomy and equality. Theirs was a campaign of terminally online masculinity, largely designed for men, expressed in brutish terms of violence, strength, and power. Trump insisted, in one late campaign appearance, that he would be a protector of women, “whether the women like it or not.” The vice president–elect, J. D. Vance, was revealed to have personal disgust for child-free women, whom he had described as “cat ladies” and “sociopathic.” He’d also, on one podcast, affirmed that the entire function “of the postmenopausal female” was caring for grandchildren. The super PAC founded by Elon Musk, who has shown great enthusiasm for personally inseminating women, released an ad referring to Kamala Harris as a “C word.” (The ad, which was deleted a few days later, winkingly revealed the C to stand for “Communist.”) And on X, Musk himself reposted a theory that “a Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson excitedly compared Trump’s return to office to a strict father coming home to give his wayward daughter “a vigorous spanking.”None of this is new, necessarily. But as of this writing, men ages 18 to 29 have swung a staggering 15 points to the right since 2020, according to an Associated Press survey of registered voters. A few years ago, researchers at Penn State found that people’s alignment with the ideals of “hegemonic masculinity”—the celebration of male dominance in society and of stereotypically masculine traits—predicted their support for Trump in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Since then, our cultural environment has been flooded with ever more avatars of dopey machismo: steroid-ingesting, crypto-shilling, energy-drink-chugging bros; YouTubers and podcast hosts and misogynist influencers, all profiting wildly from the juvenile attention economy. The language that the Trump-Vance campaign used was intended to resonate with this audience, even if it sounded asinine to everyone else. (“Tampon Tim,” the right-wing social-media nickname given to Tim Walz for approving a measure that supplies period products to Minnesota public-school students, is an insult only if you’re 8 years old or terrified of women’s bodies.)From the January/February 2024 issue: Four more years of unchecked misogynyBut the philosophy of the people soon to be in power isn’t informed just by emotionally stunted Twitch streamers and playground bullies. Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur and conservative power broker who did more than anyone to further Vance’s post-law career and helped fund his bid for Senate, wrote in a 2009 essay that women getting the vote had doomed “capitalist democracy.” Trump’s ally and former aide John McEntee posted on X in October: “Sorry we want MALE only voting. The 19th might have to go.” For all the attention-getting antics of Trump’s extremely online contingent, his brain trust consists mainly of very wealthy, very powerful men who think women’s rights have simply gone too far. Forget the hope for a female president, or the fury at the fact that a charming, hardworking, genuinely inspirational candidate like Harris couldn’t break through all the accreted layers of American prejudice. What is going to happen to women now?not all trump voters embrace misogyny. And preliminary exit polling shows that a sizable minority of American women voted for him this time; in an economy that’s getting more precarious for every successive generation, both men and women may have been swayed by the promise of prosperity. Still, the teased enforcement of outdated gender roles has clearly connected with young men in particular. Among voters ages 18 to 29, the gender gap was striking: about 16 points, according to the AP.The Trump-Vance administration can’t obligate women to go back to the 1960s, though. It can’t force women out of the workforce. And it can’t mandate that women be subservient to men, sexually, romantically, or professionally. One has to wonder, then, what will become of the men who have been reared on Andrew Tate TikToks and violent gonzo porn devoted to women’s sexual degradation. The gender divide is about to grow into a chasm.In the U.S., 63 percent of men under 30 are currently single, compared with 34 percent of women in the same age group, according to the Pew Research Center. This suggests that women aren’t the only ones who may ultimately suffer from this coming rupture in American life. So, too, will the men who have been trained to see women as disgusting, untamable, fundamentally inferior to them.“Good on Paper”: Are young men really becoming more sexist?For all Vance and Musk purport to worry about birth rates, I’d argue that they have done more to dissuade women from having children than almost anyone else, by enabling the radicalization and isolation of Gen Z men. For thousands of years, marriage was a necessity for women—a means of financial security and social acceptance. This isn’t true anymore. Many women simply aren’t willing or remotely motivated to attach themselves to men who denigrate them, or to stay in abusive marriages for the sake of their children, as Vance once seemed to suggest that they should.In my own circle of friends, I see women living contentedly alone rather than settling for men who don’t respect them. I see intelligent, kind, high-achieving friends thriving in their community, spending their own money, appreciating culture, taking care of their own needs and taking care of one another. Within hours of the election result becoming clear, Google searches went up sharply for South Korea’s feminist protest movement “4B”—a social philosophy that advocates for women not to date, marry, have sex with, or have children with men. (South Korea currently has the lowest fertility rate of any country in the world.)Anna Louie Sussman: The real reason South Koreans aren’t having babiesAmerican conservatism has long fetishized motherhood in a way that made it proximate to power—mothers are lionized and even encouraged to seek political office, as long as it’s understood that they’re doing so on behalf of others. Sarah Palin, the first female vice-presidential candidate on a Republican ticket, tried to defang her own ambition by suggesting that she was just a hockey mom who got involved. But the kind of motherhood now being promoted on the right is much more passive, and powerless. It’s the kind modeled by the former Supreme Court clerk Usha Vance, who stands by silently while her husband weakly brushes off his racist fans’ attacks on his family. It’s also exemplified by the tradwives of TikTok and Instagram, who cater to the male gaze with their doe-eyed; paisley-smock-wearing; Kinder, Kirche, Küche performances of submissive domesticity.The gender dynamics of this moment cannot be a surprise to anyone. Since his arrival in politics, in 2015, Trump has made his thoughts on women abundantly clear. He’s propagated the idea that those of us who don’t flatter or agree with him are not just difficult but “nasty,” using the language of disgust to make women seem contaminated and morally reprehensible. He has shamed women for the way they look, for aging, for having opinions. (Those of us who have public personas online have experienced this sort of treatment too, and have seen it snowball with his encouragement.) None of this is in any way negated by his decision to make a woman his chief of staff, or to nominate women for key positions.Even before Harris officially became the nominee in 2024, Trump’s allies were attacking her in sexualized terms, subliminally linking female power to the so-called threat of unfettered female sexuality. Early in July, Alec Lace—the host of a podcast dedicated to fatherhood, if you can believe it—referred to Harris on the Fox Business channel as “the original Hawk Tuah girl,” a reference to a viral clip about oral sex. In August, Trump circulated a post on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that insinuated that Harris had performed sexual favors to establish her career in politics. In September, Semafor reported that a shadowy conservative network had been paying influencers to promote sexualized smears of Harris. In October, a billboard in Ohio briefly drew consternation for displaying a mocked-up image of Harris on her hands and knees, about to engage in a sex act. (It was paid for by a towing company.)The old analytical terms we use to describe sexism in politics aren’t sufficient to deal with this onslaught of repugnant hatred. Michelle Obama was right, in her closing argument of the 2024 campaign, to note that Harris had faced an astonishing double standard: Both the media and Americans more broadly had picked apart her arguments, bearing, and policy details while skating over Trump’s “erratic behavior; his obvious mental decline; his history as a convicted felon, a known slumlord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse.” She also captured the stakes of the election when she said that voters were fundamentally making a choice in 2024 about “our value as women in this world.” On that front, the people have spoken. But women don’t have to play along.All his life, Trump has ruined people who get close to him. He won’t ruin women, but he will absolutely destroy a generation of men who take his vile messaging to heart. And, to some extent, the damage has already been done.This article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline “The Gender War Is Here.”More StoriesCher Has a History Lesson for Us AllThe Silliest, Sexiest Show of the Year

CONTENT: The Harris-campaign leadership believes that the Democrats narrowed the gap on Trump that Biden left—but not by enough.In the past few days, four of the senior officials who directed Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign spoke with me about how the race unfolded, from the chaotic first weeks after President Joe Biden’s sudden withdrawal until the final hours of Election Day. My conversations with Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair; David Plouffe, the former Barack Obama campaign manager enlisted as a senior adviser; Quentin Fulks, the principal deputy campaign manager with responsibility for broadcast advertising; and Rob Flaherty, a deputy campaign manager in charge of digital operations and advertising, offered a view into their decision making through every stage of the campaign.In these interviews, and another one that these principals conducted recently with alumni of the Obama campaigns on the podcast Pod Save America, the senior Harris-campaign leadership was notably unremorseful about the choices it made in Harris’s failed sprint to the White House. Instead, the officials stressed the welter of difficult decisions that rapidly engulfed them from the moment Biden stepped aside. No president in modern times had withdrawn from the race so close to Election Day. Immediately, Harris had to formally secure the Democratic nomination, put her own stamp on the Biden campaign operation, introduce herself to voters, and begin the process of digging out from the deficit in the polls that Biden left after his disastrous June debate performance against Donald Trump.“Our first week, it was like, Well, we need a biography ad; we need to talk about the border; we need to lay out an economic contrast; we need to get health care in there, abortion,” Plouffe told me. “If you have six, seven, eight months, you storyboard all this stuff, you have a narrative arc. Everything was smashed and collided here.”The analysis of the race from Harris’s senior team won’t satisfy the shell-shocked Democratic critics who believe that the campaign’s tactical choices and the vice president’s occasional missteps as a candidate contributed materially to her defeat. They described what critics consider her most obvious blunders as largely irrelevant to the outcome.Franklin Foer: Why Biden’s team thinks Harris lostSome on the left believe that Harris depressed turnout among the party’s core voters by emphasizing her support from anti-Trump Republicans such as former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Some in the center believe she erred by not renouncing more forcefully the progressive positions she’d adopted during her ill-fated 2020 primary run. Others wonder how her campaign could raise more than $1 billion and still end up losing and in debt. Across the party, the most commonly held criticism has been that Harris should have done more to separate herself from Biden.Against those complaints, her campaign leadership argued that no matter the tactics or the messages they tried, Harris could never fully escape the vortex of voter discontent with the economy, the country’s overall direction, and Biden’s performance as president. Even as voters remained disenchanted on all those fronts—arguably, because they remained so disenchanted—retrospective assessments of Trump’s first term were rising, to a point where, in the VoteCast survey conducted by the AP and NORC, a 52 percent majority approved of his performance. Only 42 percent of voters approved of Biden’s.“When I would recite the headwinds [to the campaign staff], they were: right track/wrong track, presidential approval, candidate part of the administration—although I think a lot of voters were willing to give her some room about how she’d be different—and approval of Trump’s first term,” Plouffe told me. “Those are historically ferocious headwinds.”And in fact, for all the focus on what Harris, Trump, and their teams did or did not do, in the history of modern polling, every time an incumbent president has faced comparable headwinds of discontent, the opposition party has won the White House—just as Trump did last month.Trump was anything but a normal candidate. As the 2024 race proceeded, however, evidently most voters were treating him as if he were one. Despite all of the controversy constantly swirling around Trump, the usual hydraulics of America’s two-party system reasserted themselves: Voters who had lost faith in a president of one party preponderantly voted for the presidential nominee of the other party. In the history of modern polling, every time a president has been about as unpopular as Biden was, either he has lost reelection (Jimmy Carter in 1980, George H. W. Bush in 1992, Trump himself in 2020) or his party has lost the White House if the incumbent himself could not or did not run again (Harry Truman in 1952, Lyndon Johnson in 1968, and George W. Bush in 2008). Against that history, the most shocking thing about the outcome, paradoxically, was how normal it was.The predominant view among Democrats has been that Harris generally played well the very poor hand Biden bequeathed her with fewer than four months until Election Day. Harris was a much steadier, engaging, even inspiring public presence than she had been in her 2020 presidential campaign (when she withdrew from the primary race before a single vote was cast) or during her first years as vice president. Since emerging as the administration’s principal voice contesting the rollback of abortion rights and other liberties by red states during Biden’s term, she had developed more confidence as a speaker, and it showed on the campaign trail. By any reasonable measure, Harris aced the biggest moments of the race: her convention speech, the September presidential debate, her closing address at the Washington Ellipse.But mistakes were made. At times, Harris seemed overly cautious and bound too tightly to talking points, especially in her early media interviews. An almost uniform consensus among Democrats determined that her lowest moment was an answer on ABC’s The View, when she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently from Biden over the past four years. In my interviews, the Harris advisers were more defensive and vague about that moment than on any other point. “It’s hard for me to put myself in the vice president’s mindset,” Fulks said. “But it is hard to differentiate yourself from an administration that you’re part of.”Harris’s lame response was a misstep that Republicans immediately converted into negative advertising. Even so, the argument that this mistake had a material impact on a race driven by such fundamental forces of discontent with the incumbent president is hard to sustain. That reality, to me, also applies to the other chief criticisms of Harris and her allied super PACs—that, for instance, they did not spend enough money on advertising to remind voters about everything people had disliked about Trump’s presidency.I’m inclined to agree with that critique, but merely pounding harder at Trump’s vulnerabilities seems unlikely to have overcome voters’ underlying discontent with the status quo. As I’ve written previously, it was not as if voters were unaware of Trump’s flaws. In the exit polls and the VoteCast survey, the two principal sources available so far on voters’ decision making, a majority of voters agreed that Trump was too extreme and would steer the U.S. toward authoritarianism. Yet a decisive slice of voters who held those negative views about Trump voted for him anyway, so strong was their desire for change.The Harris advisers all stressed that the view among most voters that they had been financially better off under Trump than they were under Biden created an overwhelming imperative for the campaign to persuade the electorate to look toward the potential risks of a second Trump term. “We had to take this conversation into the future and not just make it about the past,” O’Malley Dillon told me. Yet, like other campaigns in a similar situation—Carter against Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Bush against Bill Clinton in 1992—the Harris team found that it could not shift the attention of enough voters from their dissatisfaction with the present. As I wrote during the Bush-Clinton race, when voters are deeply unhappy with current conditions, they see stability as the risk.Once voters had reached that conclusion, many of them simply did not want to hear negative information about Trump that would cause cognitive dissonance about their choice. As Jackie Payne, the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action, which studies the political attitudes of moderate white women, told me shortly before the election, many female voters who believed that Trump would improve their economic situation simply dismissed any rhetoric and proposals from him that they might find troubling. “They were choosing to believe a vision of him that was aligned with what they wanted to get out of him—a strong economy—and they were absolutely discounting anything that felt extreme as disinformation or hyperbole, even if he said he would do it,” she said.Amid all the geographic and demographic analyses of the results, one data point stood out to me as perhaps the most revealing about the outcome. The CNN polling unit provided me with an analysis of the exit polls that looked at the voters who supported legal abortion in all or most circumstances but who also viewed the economy in negative terms (as either not so good or poor). That turned out to be a surprisingly large group: 36 percent of all voters held both those views. They were a group simultaneously drawn to each side’s strongest argument: Trump’s case that he could better manage the economy and Harris’s contention that Trump was a threat to abortion rights (as well as other freedoms and democracy itself). In the trial of strength for voters swayed by the two parties’ central claims, the analysis found that slightly more of them backed Trump than Harris.The preference for Trump among pro-choice, economically pessimistic voters was especially pronounced among white women without a college education: Two-thirds of them with those views supported the former president, the exit poll found. And, just as in 2016, those blue-collar white women proved essential to Trump’s narrow victories in the three former Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which once again decided the outcome. Harris fell short because for too many voters—especially working-class voters living paycheck to paycheck—inflation and economic discontent, reinforced in some cases by unhappiness about immigration and crime, trumped abortion and democracy.In a race shaped so profoundly by fundamental forces of disaffection with the country’s direction, could anything have changed the outcome? As the Democratic strategist Mike Podhorzer has argued, more voters might have ranked their hesitations about Trump higher if the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court had not blocked any chance that the former president would face a criminal trial before this election on the charges that he tried to subvert the previous one. Plouffe pointed to another what-if potentially big enough to have changed the result: Biden’s withdrawal from the race much earlier rather than only after his disastrous debate performance in June. If Biden had dropped out last winter, Plouffe argued to me, Democrats could have held a full-fledged primary that would have either produced a nominee more distant from his administration or strengthened Harris by requiring her to establish her independence. Looking back at what contributed to Trump’s victory, Plouffe said pointedly, Biden’s choice not to step aside sooner was “the cardinal sin.”Even so, Plouffe acknowledged, “I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won.” For all the difficulties that the atmosphere created for Harris, the election unquestionably raised warning signs for Democrats that extend beyond dissatisfaction with current conditions. It continued an erosion that is ominous for the party in its support among working-class nonwhite voters, particularly Latino men. And as Flaherty, the deputy campaign manager, told me, the Republican Party’s win powerfully demonstrated that it—or at least Trump himself—has built more effective mechanisms for communicating with infrequent voters, especially young men who don’t consume much conventional political news.Those are real challenges Democrats will debate in the coming months. They will also be pondering the painful question of whether enough voters (including female voters) are willing to elect a woman president—Plouffe and his colleagues acknowledged that this had likely been another obstacle in Harris’s way. But the biggest reason behind the 2024 election result, from any angle, looks more straightforward.In 2008, when Obama won the election to succeed an unpopular president from the other party, the exit poll found that 62 percent of voters who said they were dissatisfied with conditions in the country voted for him. In 2024, when Trump won the election to succeed an unpopular president from the other party, the exit poll found that, again, 62 percent of voters dissatisfied with conditions in the country voted for him. Even against an opponent carrying as much baggage as Trump, the Harris campaign was never able to overcome the axiomatic principle of presidential elections: When one party sinks in the public’s esteem, the other rises.The transcript of my conversations with Harris’s team members has been edited for clarity.What was the state of the race on the day that Biden withdrew and Harris announced her candidacy?O’Malley Dillon: We had just come through a tough period, so we were on the outer edges of some of the [polling] margins that we would want to be seeing. We definitely saw fundamental challenges with the national headwinds on the key issues, and we saw a tough battleground map. It was a harder environment than we had faced previously, even [from earlier] in the cycle.Plouffe: When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome. The Sun Belt was worse than the Blue Wall, but the Blue Wall was bad. And, demographically, young voters across the board—Hispanic voters, Black voters, Asian voters—were in really terrible shape. When the [candidate] switch happened, some of that stuff got a little bit better, but nowhere near where we ended up or where we needed to be. This was a rescue mission. It was catastrophic in terms of where it was.Fulks: At the time, we were in damage control. We definitely saw a pathway because these are battleground states, and this country is pretty evenly split down the middle. [But] there would have been considerable work to do, motivating people to turn out to vote.What were voters’ perceptions of Harris when she entered the race?Fulks: As crazy as it may sound to say, because she’s the vice president, we had a candidate who was relatively unknown—in her bio, where she came from, her value set, her motivation … something I like to call a “voter value proposition” of why are they voting for this person; who is this person? And can they trust them to deliver on what they say that they’re going to deliver on?O’Malley Dillon: We knew out of the gate that there was a lack of awareness about her, a lack of an awareness about what she did as vice president, which is consistent with most vice presidents. That was a big part of our early strategy and certainly made the 107 days we had more complex than they would traditionally be.Read: The Democrats’ 2022 error messagePlouffe: When she got in [the race], her favorable rating, I believe, was 35 or 36 [percent]. When you dug beneath that, there wasn’t much stickiness outside core Democrats. [Voters’ perception of her] was unformed but negative.What were Harris’s biggest needs as she entered the race?Fulks: The biggest imperative for her was shoring up Democratic base support—those voters among whom we saw a little less enthusiasm for President Biden. That was a metric we were really watching. Then it was really the race to define herself.Plouffe: There’s a lot to do in a presidential campaign: biography, contrast, positive economy … We had a condensed time frame, so we weren’t going to be able to do all the things you would have liked. There was the reality of where the race stood with the electorate, and then there were some of the operational challenges we faced.Fulks: We knew that we had an opportunity to introduce her upbringing and her accomplishments in public service outside the Biden administration. And some of that aligned [as a way to rebut] the attacks that were coming at her—such as on immigration. [We could talk about] her being a prosecutor from a border state, going after cartels, gang members. It was an easy segue into introducing her and at the same time defending her from attacks that had started before she even became the top of the ticket.Through 2023 and 2024, voters’ retrospective assessments of Trump’s presidency were improving. What did that mean for the race?O’Malley Dillon: There’s no doubt that we saw him carry higher numbers, and they were more durable for much of the election. And that’s why we had to ensure that we were doing everything in our power to tell the story of the vice president … while doing what we could to be clear that a second term of Donald Trump would be worse for the American people. We felt we couldn’t just do one or the other. And we spent a lot of time [talking about] Project 2025.Plouffe: It was a massive problem. We had somebody whose approval rating for his first term was about 10 points higher than the current incumbent.So it was mission critical to raise the stakes of a Trump second term. Why? Because people’s view of the first term was too positive; it meant he was going to win the election. That was a problem when we started this thing, and it was a problem when we ended this thing.Trump’s retrospective approval ratings were higher in some cases than they ever were when he was president. Why do you think it was improving so much?Plouffe: One is he was the former president; you had a current president. So people were unhappy, and that [was an] easy reference point between now versus then. Two, there’s no doubt that from a price standpoint, things were lower. Harris is good about this; she understood people’s reality, but too many Democrats would want to lecture about the GDP and unemployment rate and inflation settling down, but [voters still feel that] things are a lot more expensive.A third piece of this, which we heard particularly with younger voters—not first-time voters but voters who are mid-20s to mid-30s—is the country was still standing. So [to] the argument that the country would end, or democracy would end, people were like, ‘Well, I don’t know. We’re still here.’”What political considerations went into the selection of the vice-presidential nominee?Plouffe: I think she thought that if she were to win, Tim Walz was the kind of person she’d want as a counselor. And clearly, he had had political success in the Midwest, so even though Minnesota wasn’t an important battleground, he would be an effective surrogate out there.Given the uphill nature of the race, was there any thought of a more dramatic pick—like, say, Gretchen Whitmer to create an all-female ticket?Plouffe: Historically, the vice-presidential selection matters very little in terms of vote. So would even [Governor] Josh Shapiro have delivered us Pennsylvania, given that we were down about 1.8 points? I don’t think so. History suggests that the only place the vice-presidential pick generally has made a difference is when you make a mistake.As Harris settled into the race through August and September, were there any points where you considered yourself clearly ahead?O’Malley Dillon: No, not in a durable way. We saw early on … a consolidation of our support, and we saw some key metrics start moving, including, over time, a 10-point increase in the vice president’s favorability. We were very pleased with how strong the vice president was in the debate … and we saw a bump there. But there was no point at all where data told us anything but that this was an extremely close race.Plouffe: When we came in, Trump was at 48 percent, but Biden was in the high 30s to low 40s. Harris started there. We were getting back Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. So the movement was stuff that was easier for us to move. The tougher stuff to move is true undecideds or lean-Trump [voters], and ultimately we weren’t able to do enough of it.Why did she choose to minimize engagements with the media in the first weeks?Fulks: I don’t say this to be defensive at all, but our priority was How do we get her into the battleground states? She [had been] traveling, but she was focused on the periphery states when she was the vice president and not the core battleground states, as President Biden was traveling to those places pretty frequently.Why did she choose right from the outset not to challenge Trump’s plans for mass deportation?Fulks: Our focus was on really making sure that we were protecting her flank on this. Republicans had done three years of advertising and campaigning against the vice president on immigration. We weren’t afraid to take it on: In her very first speech, she called out Trump for killing the bipartisan border deal and she promised she would bring it back. She went to the border and proposed her own plan to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and illegal crossings. We chose to focus more on the affirmative and shoring her up on the issue than the negative element of [Trump’s mass-deportation plan].Plouffe: The economy “drove vote,” as we saw it based on our research, but the border did as well. Those were the two main headwinds. Now you see it in exit polls and polling; we saw it in our own research. We narrowed the gap on immigration a lot. But that was still a pronounced headwind.How did the changing information environment affect your strategy?Flaherty: We came into this election with a bunch of core assumptions. One was that this is a race that was going to be decided by low-information voters, voters who didn’t consume the news, voters who specifically made decisions to tune out politics in their life. Another [was] that we have an information environment that was defined by not just polarization but personalization, as algorithms are really dictating content selections. All of those things are factoring together to mean it’s harder than ever to reach voters and that the campaign is going to have to be in as many places as possible.Was the assumption that it was going to be a race decided by low-information voters because presidential races involve a bigger electorate that includes those people? Or was there something about running against Trump that made that even more the case?Flaherty: It’s a gumbo of the changing dynamics of the media environment since 2020, the nature of running against Donald Trump—who is the absolute best at generating attention for himself—and the fact that a lot of voters only show up in presidential elections. And those voters tend to be less civic-minded; they’ve got jobs, they’ve got better stuff to do than pay attention to politics. For all of those reasons, this was going to be a How do you reach people who don’t want to be reached? election.How did your ability to reach those voters change when Harris replaced Biden?Flaherty: The enormous groundswell of enthusiasm for the vice president gave people air cover to go out and talk to their friends and talk to their family, and post for themselves and curate themselves. It also gave air cover to creators and podcasters who didn’t want to get involved with politics before. In all of those corners, it made people start paying attention to the election earlier and made it cooler to engage with us.Listen: A former Republican strategist on why Harris lostWe did literally dozens of interviews and short engagements with influencers and content creators. We had content creators in the actual program of our convention. This was a huge part of our strategy all the way through the end. But [the Trump campaign was] laser-focused on one audience: young men. We were focused all over the board on people we needed to consolidate. That was always a challenge.After the debate, had you moved ahead in the race?Plouffe: No. There might have been one run of internal analytics that had us up in all three Blue Wall states, but it was by a point. This notion that we had a lead post-debate that we squandered—we never saw that internally.The Trump campaign and allied super PACs pounded Harris with negative advertising in the swing states, including one memorable ad that attacked her position on transition surgery for transgender inmates. Some of the most pointed second-guessing that the Harris campaign faced was frustration that it did not respond directly to that ad. But Harris’s advisers insisted that a direct response was not the best way to handle those attacks.Fulks: [The impact of those ads] is probably not as much as people think. The trans issue ranked very low. All of our data, both quantitative and qualitative, said that voters wanted to hear about immigration, the economy, and crime. The [Trump team] really closed this campaign on the economy and immigration.Flaherty: We tested all of these things, and what we found was that [ads] that specifically rebutted the attack [were less effective] than her just talking about the economy. The trans thing was one plank that sat under a broader argument that she [was too] liberal, and that was damaging, certainly. We worked to counter that with the Liz Cheney events and the videos of Republican people who worked for Trump saying You can’t vote for him; he’s dangerous.Harris’s appearances with Cheney had some left-leaning activists complaining that they diluted Democratic enthusiasm. How do you respond to that?O’Malley Dillon: We believe that the coalition to beat Trump requires moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats of all stripes. It was the strength of her leadership that all of those people could see themselves in this campaign and in her candidacy.Plouffe: We did it for two reasons: One was to create a permission structure for the type of voters we thought we needed to get to 50 percent in some of these states. Second, it was also a permission structure for the broader electorate. Having all these Republicans out there for us also helped inoculate us—and we saw this in our research—to some of the attacks that she’s a crazy California liberal.Was support for legal abortion less of a factor in 2024 than it was in 2022, in the first election after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade?O’Malley Dillon: In ’22, Dobbs was very fresh, and women leaned toward reproductive freedom as a driving force; we saw less of that this time.Plouffe: I think abortion was still a critical part of why the race was so close despite the negative atmosphere, and [was] what fueled a lot of the activism and financial contributions. But there are going to be some voters who are pro-choice, who care about it, but if they’re pressed economically, they may decide to vote more on prices than on concern about a national abortion ban.Harris campaigned in all seven of the swing states right up until the end, including some that Trump ended up winning decisively, such as Arizona and North Carolina. Did the campaign really feel it could win all of them, or was it trying to project strength by continuing to appear in them?O’Malley Dillon: We were very clear and very public that we saw the Blue Wall as the most straightforward path to 270, and we never deviated from that vision. At the same time, we were also very clear that while the Sun Belt was a more challenging path, it was still within the margin. We definitely thought they were in play, but we also never lost sight of the Blue Wall being the most straightforward path.Fulks: When you’re in the last week or two of the campaign, if you’re still seeing a margin-of-error race, pulling out of one of those states could be a huge mistake. You don’t keep a wide map [open] just to close it with a week left.In the final week of the campaign, Trump seemed to be stepping on land mines every day, starting with his chaotic rally at Madison Square Garden. Yet exit polls found that most voters who said they decided in that final week broke for Trump. What was your read on that?Plouffe: We’d talk about [how] he’s reminding people about some of the things they don’t like about him; she’s closing well, maybe that means the people who break late will break more in our direction and maybe it’ll hurt him on turnout. But what overwhelmed that was just people’s unhappiness with the current situation and wanting change.So how, finally, did the race look to you on Election Day?O’Malley Dillon: We came in ahead in our data in Michigan and Wisconsin, and tied in Pennsylvania; we had seen growth week after week on our direct-voter contact. Our atmospherics were quite strong. That doesn’t make an election victory, but [given] the metrics we were looking at, we felt positioned to win a very, very close race.Plouffe: Very early, I got up and went to the Lincoln Memorial and spent a little time with Lincoln, and I just said, ‘God, I hope there’s a miracle here.’ So I was hopeful but not super-optimistic.Fulks: The undecideds that we felt would break for us ultimately broke for Trump. And that is what did it. But you don’t know that until the polls are closing and numbers are being reported.Since the election, many Democrats have focused on the fact that Trump won, by last count, about 2.8 million more votes than he did in 2020 while Harris polled about 6.7 million fewer than Biden. Did Harris fall short in the battleground states because Trump won more votes than you expected or because Harris won fewer?Fulks: For me, it’s about the votes we didn’t get [rather than] Trump getting so many more. Those undecided voters who make or break elections all the time—they just broke in Trump’s favor.Plouffe: I will confess to you the headwinds outside those [battlegrounds] surprised me a bit—New Jersey moving double digits, Connecticut moving double digits. The blue-state shifts are hard to get your arms around, because that’s a big shift in four years.While the Harris team was defensive about the question of whether she should have done more to separate from Biden, it was united in agreeing that the results signaled long-term challenges for the Democratic Party, even if it rejected the assertion from Trump and his allies that his national-popular-vote margin of about 1.6 percentage points constituted a fundamental realignment favoring the GOP.Plouffe: I don’t think this is a permanent realignment, but we have seen, over a number of elections, some movement. And the math is the math: There are a lot more noncollege voters than there are college [voters] in most states. The math doesn’t work for the Democrats to win national elections, particularly in higher-turnout elections, if you lose much more of the noncollege vote, whether it be white, Black, brown, or Asian.O’Malley Dillon: It is clear we’re going to need to do the work to reach [some voter segments]. No doubt, a lot of this country is anti-establishment and doesn’t subscribe to political information or traditional media. How do we reach those voters?Plouffe: I would put the economy at the top of the reasons [for the decline with nonwhite voters]: people feeling their paycheck wasn’t going as far as they’d like. But there is a cultural thing, a sense that Trump [is] not talking like a politician, not being politically correct all the time. That appeals to some of these voters. Some of the most successful Democratic politicians of the past half century—Clinton or Obama—they can communicate with people in a way that is not condescending, that seems connected to their lives.How much did Harris’s race or gender affect the outcome? Can a woman win the presidency in today’s America?Plouffe: I’m really eager for political scientists and researchers to try to get an answer to this, because we certainly picked up some headwinds. Maybe statistically this will be disproven, but I think, given the ’16 experience and this experience, it’s probably a bigger burden to be elected president running as a woman than as a person of color.I think America is ready to elect a woman president. Running for president and winning is an indescribably hard obstacle course. This throws another obstacle into the field. And that makes me incredibly sad to say that.This year marked a clear turning point as both campaigns shifted their attention from mainstream outlets to niche media sources aimed at more narrow segments of the electorate. How did these new dynamics shape the campaign, and what do they mean for elections going forward?Fulks: Republicans have a very good echo chamber regarding how they get their information out. Democrats will need to loosen up and take advantage of a changing media environment.Flaherty: Trump did 30 podcasts to one audience. We did podcasts to a bunch of different audiences, which meant we never really got that frequency. The other lesson is that the nature of attention is fleeting, particularly in this media ecosystem. That is one of the things we struggled with. We were an attention machine for the first four weeks, then it was an open [competition] for attention—and that’s a cage fight with a guy whose entire life has been about getting attention for himself.We clean up with the most politically engaged people. For folks who don’t have time to engage in politics, or folks who are just receiving a little bit of information here and there, usually from friends and family, the information environment is much more difficult, much more competitive, and much more tied to culture. If we Democrats want to win, particularly nationally, that’s the space that we’ve got to figure out, and quick.Plouffe: If you had said two years ago Harris will be the nominee and she’ll do as well with seniors as she did, you might have said no. The reason is [that] those tend to be larger consumers of information. They also tended to be the voters who understood the stakes of the second Trump term more. The threat, whether it was abortion or democracy or rule of law, mattered more to them than younger parts of the electorate.Do Republicans have a systematic advantage in reaching lower-propensity voters?Flaherty: There’s the conservative ecosystem, which is Fox, Ben Shapiro, [Sean] Hannity, Newsmax—all these folks that are politically and ideologically aligned with Donald Trump and the work of electing conservatives. They built and cultivated that ecosystem. They also built and cultivated an ecosystem that was less political but more cultural. You can call it the “manosphere,” but I don’t think the manosphere is inherently partisan. Joe Rogan talked about politics, but that’s not his whole thing. That was an audience that [Republicans] viewed as key to mobilizing, and so they did a lot of work to migrate information, values, and Trump himself between the conservative ecosystem and this culturally aligned ecosystem.There’s just not an analogous system on the left. It doesn’t exist because our voters don’t have the same demand signal for alternative media to the mainstream press. There just isn’t the same kind of profit incentive for alternative media.Does the election signal a lasting electoral advantage for Trump-style conservative populism over the Democratic Party?Flaherty: It does seem to me this particular version of conservatism has a cultural cachet among young people. I don’t think that’s an immutable fact. But I do think the nexus of Trump-style conservatism and culture is a thing that Democrats, progressives, folks on the left are going to have to grapple with.Caitlin Flanagan: The Democrats’ billionaire mistakeO’Malley Dillon: I push against some estimation of this race being a great realignment. This is an anomaly race—because of Trump, and because of a 107-day campaign. The picture about working-class voters in America is pretty nuanced: We definitely saw declines there, but with the white working class we actually saw stability, and we saw increases with seniors.Plouffe: If you look at the last four elections, there has been a drift [toward Republicans among non-college-educated voters of all races]. You have to arrest their gains, and we’ve got to begin to gain back. I think that’s possible, because we live in an era in which, because of economic inequality, generally there’s economic dissatisfaction. Incumbent parties are falling all over the globe, and then—what has also happened—whoever replaces them becomes unpopular pretty quickly.I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won. But if we had a primary in which a bunch of people ran and auditioned … through that process, whoever emerged … would have been a more fully formed person, would have had more time to mount a general election campaign. [Not having that process] is the cardinal sin.More StoriesThe Democrats’ 2022 Error MessageWhat Swayed Trump Voters Was Bidenomics

CONTENT: Are you dreading a possible debate over politics on Thanksgiving? TV personality Alexander Heffner, who specializes in food and politics, knows the feeling. He's shared salmon burgers with Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, and eaten crab cakes with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia while dissecting policies.As Turkey Day quickly approaches, the host of "Breaking Bread with Alexander" on Bloomberg TV and "The Open Mind" on PBS, Heffner, 35, undoubtedly will chat about the nation's state of affairs while passing the gravy. He shares with USA TODAY some tips on how to move deftly through the topic so no one throws cranberries and potatoes (or stuffing) at each other.Question: You talk about deep topics over a hearty meal for a living. What would be the best, and perhaps unavoidable way to bring up politics during Thanksgiving?Heffner: As long as you are civil—and that means genuinely listening even when you disagree—it really shouldn’t be a problem to share with family members for whom you voted and why.Humanize it: How has this election impacted you? How do you hope the new administration will help you? Democrats and Republicans, by their very definitions, both believe in representative government. The disagreements are more often about the means of solving a problem than the ends of agreeing on what the problem is.

OpinionThat election conversation you're dreading may be an act of love this ThanksgivingWhat's the best conversation you’ve recently had with a politician that resembles a Thanksgiving dinner and politics discussion? How did the discussion start? Where did it go and how did it end?Throughout both seasons of the series this happened. It’s hard to pick the best because they all resembled that in my mind. Maybe Senator (soon to be Majority Leader John) Thune of South Dakota started by discussing basketball and his dad’s service in WWII, evolving to understand why the GOP has turned isolationist and leaving him genuinely considering the disproportionate sacrifices of the volunteer military since Vietnam.Anytime you can stop a politician in their tracks and get them to explain how to end the “mean-spiritedness” of politics (in Thune’s words), it’s a rare win. In the interview, I mention that when the Democratic and Republican caucus leadership show up for the C-SPAN cameras these days, invariably it feels like they’re in different worlds. But…Thune said if we brought fresh pizzas and ice cream on the Senate floor more often, there would be a happier compromise. And, can Thanksgiving dinner also be used as a time for healing or a moment of realization?It can be, for sure. In my interviews with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and North Dakota Gov.

Booker when talking about a mom’s loss of her son to gun violence in his community and Burgum when talking about the generations of families that were in business with his grandad’s grain elevator.So if you get comfortable over Thanksgiving, maybe over pumpkin pie and a little booze, there’s no reason we can’t open up to each other.

I'd jump at the opportunity to break bread with the two presidential tickets AFTER the flares of the election have calmed.Why?Because it would be a show of national solidarity and a demonstration of their ability to reset and work together. Politics is about personal and partisan ego in the heat of campaigns, but when governing it can also be about modeling deliberative compromise and delivering sound policies for people.I'd also love to bring together four of my previous "Breaking Bread" guests who share in this mission. Senators Murkowski, Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Shelly Capito (R-W. Va), and Booker come to mind. I believe together, we could have a fun meal and arrive at some greater legislative harmony and enduring bipartisan solutions.

CONTENT: Who else but Sigmund Freud to help explain?Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.In the decade since Donald Trump began to define American politics, critics have struggled to understand his massive appeal. They have perhaps sensed by now that Trump’s support comes from someplace underneath conscious and rational political analyses. Who else but Sigmund Freud to help explain? “The past few years,” the academic and critic Merve Emre wrote in an essay for The New Yorker this past June, “have given us a Freud for the pandemic, a Freud for Ukraine and a Freud for Palestine, a Freud for transfemininity, a Freud for the far right, and a Freud for the vipers’ nest that is the twenty-first-century American university.” History has now given us another iteration: a Freud for the Trump movement.Consensus on the causes of Trump’s sweeping electoral victory has formed around the idea that voters were responding to Democratic performance on material matters, namely inflation and immigration. But the Trump movement has never been, to my mind, strictly concerned with tangible issues; part of the allure is immaterial by nature, addressed to elemental human urges. Trump offered something special on that count from the beginning—a politics consisting not mainly of a positive vision but rather of a series of opportunities to own the libs. In this project, rational policy details aren’t a priority and are sometimes absent altogether; the point is domination of one’s enemies, a libidinal desire.Consider the recent post-election slogan “Your body, my choice,” also engineered to upset and humiliate liberals: It’s an overt statement of sex and dominion. And Trump draws that out in people. “Disinhibition,” the New York Times writer Ezra Klein wrote recently, “is the engine of Trump’s success. It is a strength.” Trump is in touch with the impulses and desires that run counter to social norms, and he invites his audience to put aside the usual internal barriers to acting on or voicing them. This moment is an opportune one for a revival of Freud, whose work, with its signature focus on subterranean inner worlds, helps make sense of these tendencies and their implications for politics.Read: Washington is shockedThe temptation to psychologize one’s political opponents typically wins out after defeat, the political theorist and professor Corey Robin told me recently. (An easy claim to test: Among the surge of post-election takes is a subgenre of explanatory pieces evaluating the psyches of unexpected Trump voters—suggestions that Latinos are wedded to political strongmen, or that conservative wives cast their votes for right-wingers purely out of fear or submission.) In those periods, “Freud is mobilized to explain why the left failed—not because of institutions or specific forms of economic power or the Cold War, etc., but instead because of psychic structures that the left never really touched,” Robin said. Freud offers something more than simply assigning diagnoses to opponents: “an archaeology of the mind,” Robin told me, that aims to unearth emotions and desires that people aren’t necessarily aware of themselves.That sort of excavation can be useful. Freud helps in forming an account of what people are drawn to in Trump—what pleasure, what gratification. Gary Greenberg, a writer and psychotherapist, argued in a 2018 Guardian essay that Trump is a figure who beckons America back to prior states of development—an indicator that the death drive is at work. Trump, Greenberg wrote, “urges us all to shake loose the surly bonds of civilized conduct: to make science irrelevant and rationality optional, to render truth obsolete, to set power free to roam the world, to lift all the core conditions written into the social contract—fealty to reason, skepticism about instincts, aspirations to justice.” Trump is, in other words, an atavist, inviting citizens to satisfy all of their hungry drives, all of their libidinous instincts: His America is a place for malign energies to express themselves in action. There’s a certain pleasure in that, perhaps, a kind of psychic relief—to lose oneself in a radical movement and to express feelings normally prohibited by society.Today’s left-of-center would also be wise to consider what Freud might teach them about countering an appeal like Trump’s. In an essay published in Jacobin shortly before the election, the author and psychoanalyst Eric Reinhart argued that liberals have still failed to reckon with the psychological tendencies Freud identified that facilitate mass political movements like those of the president-elect. “Proponents of progressive ideals must instead take the reality of aggression, racism, and sadomasochism seriously as enduring political feelings, including in their own ranks, that require constructive political redress,” Reinhart wrote. This doesn’t mean indulging those feelings—rather, it means offering a politics built to contain them. “To craft an effective liberal or left politics, we must stop vainly demanding that people be more reasonable and own up to the persistent reality of destructive human tendencies that manifest not only around Trump but also in countless contexts throughout history,” Reinhart wrote.Read: What to read if you’re angry about the electionFreudian psychoanalysis has, in the past several decades, faded from a feverish mid-century peak. In 1960, psychoanalysts occupied the majority of psychiatry positions in the United States, but the latter half of the century saw the advent of a vituperative discursive conflict over the validity of some of Freud’s key claims and the credibility of psychoanalysis as an effective, scientific method of clinical treatment. The debate raged across disciplines—by that time, Freud and the psychoanalytic model had been absorbed into numerous other fields, including literature, politics, and sociology. And though psychoanalytic treatment has been largely replaced by more familiar forms of psychiatric care, such as psychopharmacology (the treatment of mental illness with medication) and standardized therapy, Freud’s contributions remain useful.Psychoanalyzing one’s enemies always comes with a certain degree of condescension, which is unfortunate, because the Freudian lens is an egalitarian approach so long as its advocates recognize that they, too, are ruled by motivations they cannot easily recognize or define. “Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive,” the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1936, “the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits—of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.” I believe this insight bears wide application: I’m affected enough by vibes and instincts to believe that some part of my mind beneath my conscious thoughts plays an important role in my day-to-day life and decision making, and I suspect the same is true of others. It seems to me that avid Trump support must be anchored in such parts. In that case, whatever explains the Trump movement has in some sense always been with us and has visited us historically before; let’s pray that this time, the fever breaks quickly.More StoriesThe Christian Case for Happy HolidaysWhat Do Wives Want?

CONTENT: On a mild February evening in Nashville, a curly-haired teenager and her dad climbed the steps to the public gallery of the Tennessee Senate, where a group of lawmakers in the wood-paneled chamber below would, after a brief debate and the bang of a gavel, seize control of her family’s medical decisions. As they watched over the Senate’s gilded railing last year, Tennessee Republicans voted to make it illegal for transgender minors to be prescribed certain medications and treatments for gender dysphoria.L Williams is, in many ways, a typical teenager. She loves video games, brownies and hanging out with her friends. She is, at turns, annoyed and interested by her 11th grade classes. She takes out the recycling − upon gentle suggestion from her mom. But on Dec. 4, she will climb another set of steps.This time they lead to the U.S. Supreme Court, where her story sits at the center of a watershed legal case that could affect transgender medical treatment for young people across the U.S.  The teen, identified as L in court documents, and her parents, Brian and Samantha Williams, sued Tennessee in 2023 over the gender-affirming-care ban they watched pass. The ban forced Tennessee doctors to stop treating transgender patients like L with treatments like puberty blockers and hormone therapies by March 2024.The ruling threatened to disrupt her medical treatment and endanger her mental health.Two other Tennessee families with transgender children and a Memphis-based doctor joined the lawsuit.Tennessee's law sent the Williams family scrambling to find out-of-state doctors. Some Tennessee families affected by the law left a state they felt was dangerously hostile to their family circumstances.But Brian and Samantha Williams don’t want to leave the place where they have deep family connections, or the home where their children’s growth milestones are proudly carved into the dining room doorway.The Williamses saw the lawsuit as a line in the sand staking their claim to a home in Tennessee, their own Tennessee values and their right to make private medical decisions for their children. “I don’t even want to think about having to go back to the dark place I was in before I was able to come out and access the care that my doctors have prescribed for me,” L said last year after filing the lawsuit.The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, agreed not to identify L, still a minor, by full name or photograph her in an identifiable way because of safety concerns. Samantha and Brian Williams are named plaintiffs in the lawsuit.Lawyers for the Justice Department and the ACLU will argue on Dec. 4 that the Tennessee law unconstitutionally violates the equal-protection clause on sex discrimination.The same treatments and medications Tennessee Republicans said are too dangerous for L are still available to L’s classmates and other young people in Tennessee – as long as they are not transgender or being treated for gender dysphoria. “Never in a million years did I think we were going to be going to the Supreme Court,” Samantha said in July, sitting with Brian and L at their dining room table, marveling at the “trajectory” of L’s journey over the past four years.But why wouldn't they push back, Samantha asked, for themselves and for other Tennesseans like them?Though the case has attracted national attention, it sometimes faded to the background for the Williams family this fall.They tracked updates on the case with interest, but their warm and busy Nashville home often buzzed with the everyday activities of two working parents who are raising two teenagers.Their backyard is peppered with Nerf darts, courtesy of a PVC-pipe air cannon Brian constructed with the kids, and they brought home a mischievous kitten dubbed Mushroom to join the family this fall.On a recent October evening, the family flitted around the kitchen island, the wood countertop handcrafted by Brian from reclaimed rafters. L grabbed a snack while her parents discussed what they could rustle up for dinner.A handwritten list hung nearby, outlining the Williams' family rules that prioritize kindness and community, including "love your friends and neighbors," "own your achievements and mistakes," and "apologize when you hurt others." A cheeky addition included "know how to throw a party."As lawyers in the case filed lengthy briefs through the summer, L began the 11th grade, juggling several Advanced Placement courses.L has always been a crafty kid, Samantha said when picking up a pipe cleaner toy discarded by Mushroom, and used to build "fleets" of aircraft out of pipe cleaners. She still wants to be a pilot.She spent last summer designing her first video game via self-taught computer programming and has for years produced electronic music with her friends. By October, she had picked up a new deck for DJing just in time to hold court at a Halloween party the family hosted for L’s friends. Brian helped her drape her DJ table with spider webbing and hang skeletons on the walls.L is proud to challenge Tennessee’s law, though she acknowledges some anxiety about the potential results. What effect could their lawsuit have on transgender rights across the country? What influence could Donald Trump's reelection have on the case as transgender Americans across the country are on edge regarding federal access to care?At the family’s dining room table in July, L considered a question about the impact of such a rapidly shifting landscape.“It's stressful,” L said, carefully picking her way through her next statement. Everyone, she said, should do their best to be involved in politics – “because it’s important, and it affects people.” “But, you know, I really wish I could take breaks from politics, and I didn't have to be worrying about that all the time,” she said. “But it's something I have to constantly worry about. And, you know, I feel like I have to constantly develop arguments and arm myself with the knowledge to defend this to any particular person who decides to confront me on that.”It’s something Samantha worries about, too.On Feb. 15, 2023, days after L and her father watched the Tennessee Senate pass the upper chamber’s version of the care ban, Samantha testified before a House committee to oppose the bill.  It was days before L’s 15th birthday party, and Samantha’s voice began to break as she described the party plans – pizza and brownies, of course – that every kid should have, juxtaposed with what she characterized as a violation of parental rights.“She is a happy, healthy kid who is not hurting anyone. Her joy, her smile, her confidence would not be what they are if it were not for the blockers she’s been on for a year and a half,” Samantha said. Williams and another mother of a trans teen spoke before a group of lawmakers who at times aggressively interrogated the women. “It was super-frustrating, just because they they wouldn't even take that one moment to acknowledge our story. I really tried to personalize it as much as possible,” Samantha said. “She should be worried about pizza with her friends. She should not be worried about you guys taking away her care."Watching lawmakers debate the details of her everyday reality frustrated and angered L sometimes, she said, but through the process she just wanted to talk to the lawmakers considering the bill."They tend to infantilize a lot of transgender teenagers, especially when they're talking about this legislation," L said. "I think they're going to be faced with a lot of cognitive dissonance, and I think they're either going to have to come to terms with the fact that their opinions on the matter are at least somewhat fallacious. Or they're going to have to show their true colors and reveal that they don't actually believe any of the things that they say, and what they really believe is something much worse."When Tennessee lawmakers returned to work in 2023, banning gender transition treatments for minors was the Republican supermajority's top priority.Supporters of the bill testified that medications like puberty blockers, which suppress puberty and its physical changes, can cause long-term concerns like decreased bone density, sexual dysfunction and infertility problems. Long-term psychological effects of gender transition treatments for transgender minors are understudied, supporters argued, and teens are too immature to consent to such treatments."These treatments and procedures have a lifetime of negative consequences that are irreversible," bill sponsor Rep. William Lamberth, R-Portland, said last year. He argued transgender teens needed mental health support until they could make medical decisions as an adult.In the bill, Republicans banned specific medical treatments used for a specific purpose, but they did not ban the medications outright. Despite their stated concerns about lingering consequences for adolescents, lawmakers still allowed Tennessee teenagers to access these medications for conditions like hormone disorders or early puberty − as long as they are not transgender.Leading U.S. medical organizations disagree with those assertions, stating the care is safe, effective and can be lifesaving for trans adolescents who experience higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation.The Tennessee Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics urged Republican Gov. Bill Lee last year to quash the bill, arguing doctors should be free to "follow evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines rather than politics." No doctor with experience treating transgender people testified in support of the bill.“People who disagree with Tennessee’s law can advocate for a different law through the democratic process,” Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, whose office will defend the bill in December, said in an op-ed in The Hill recently. “While the federal government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice.”But the “ask-questions-later approach” could not be further from the Williamses' journey, they said when describing L’s decision to come out as transgender."We did a lot of work trying to figure this out, ask a lot of questions and talk to our doctors and talk to therapists," Brian said. "We did our due diligence, and then all of a sudden, somebody else is telling me that I can't do this, and that it's wrong?"As L grew into adolescence, she began experiencing intense anxiety and discomfort. She felt as if she were "drowning and trapped" in the wrong body, and she couldn't focus at school or connect with friends.L said she felt “heavily emotionally distressed” as she faced going through male puberty. The experience would come with physical changes that, even if she pursued gender transition when she turned 18, could not be reversed. She felt so uncomfortable using the boys' bathroom at school she developed urinary tract infections, according to the lawsuit.“You're at a point where not only are you going through puberty, but you're also going through nightmare puberty,” L said. “I mean, obviously, nobody's 100% comfortable with (the changes,) but you're immensely uncomfortable with them.”She first came out to a friend in 2019 but wouldn't tell her mother until late 2020.Samantha and Brian soon found L a therapist, whom she began seeing regularly after she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. After six months and conversations with her pediatrician, the Williamses met with a medical team at Vanderbilt University Medical Center about starting puberty blockers to delay male puberty. There were also long, drawn-out conversations and debates in the Williamses' home, often up in Samantha and Brian’s room. Brian sometimes played devil’s advocate, to her chagrin, Samantha wryly told lawmakers last year. Her parents sometimes pushed back in ways L disagreed with. “We had to keep saying, 'We wouldn't be good parents if we weren't taking our time and asking questions,'” Samantha said.“Your job as a parent is to take care of your kid, and do your best by them,” Brian chimed in.In 2021, the Williamses decided puberty blockers were the choice for L, to her great relief. By January 2022, she had come out to extended family, classmates and teachers. More than a year after starting puberty blockers, L’s medical team and parents decided hormone therapy, which would suppress testosterone and increase estrogen in her body, was the next best step. “I was not comfortable with where I was, and I personally felt like it was urgent to have that happen,” she said, adding it is "not fun to be the first trans person someone meets."“It’s difficult to deal with that, and school and puberty and all that at once. That's why I oppose the law, obviously, because you're going to significantly impact the lives of a lot of these kids because they have to deal with the stress of school compounding with a lot of the dysphoria they feel.”In 2023, Samantha and Brian at first thought they might be exempt from incoming restrictions. L was already taking the medications, and they had done considerable due diligence with their medical team, Brian said. The state couldn’t just stop her from continuing medical treatment.But they soon realized Tennessee could. As they lobbied the Legislature to block the law, Samantha began trying to find an out-of-state clinic that could take L as a patient before her medication became illegal in Tennessee in March 2024. It felt like a race against time as the treatment landscape shifted rapidly under their feet.Before 2023, just three states had gender transition bans on the books. By the time Tennessee’s law took effect in June 2023, 20 states had banned the medical treatments for young people in some form, including a ring of states almost completely surrounding Tennessee and choking access to the treatments L had been prescribed for years. For the Williamses, it was like a falling set of dominoes. Samantha scrambled to stay ahead. After at least a dozen inquiries with clinics across the country, she found a match in Cincinnati. Samantha, eyeing the wave of bans cascading into place across the country, decided to make another appointment in North Carolina as a backup plan. The state would enact its own ban by August. But there was a catch.Unlike Tennessee's law, North Carolina's would grandfather in any teens already receiving care in the state. The Williamses made an appointment in Asheville that summer, though they continued L’s treatment in Ohio through winter 2023. Ohio's ban would come down in January 2024.The treatment scramble led to monthlong delays in L’s care because each new clinic had to follow a careful procedure to admit L as a new patient.“It's not like you go in there and they're immediately giving you prescriptions,” Brian Williams said. “There's a lot of steps you’ve got to take."Meanwhile, L watched legislative discussions that sometimes sparked anger and frustration. She said she saw similar arguments and opinions she had already seen circulate online emerge within the halls of the state Legislature. The frequent vitriol directed at transgender people was also apparent to her."Puberty has a lot of irreversible damage that comes with it. So, I think to say that you should wait to make the decision until you're 18 has a lot of consequences and permanent aspects to it. To say that, you're robbing them of one of the choices they can make, at the very least," L said. "I think that is a little bit hypocritical, unless you outright believe that someone who is transgender is inherently inferior. I know a lot of them won't say it, but that's oftentimes what they believe."The subtext surrounding the bill often cut even deeper than what was said in committee: The original version of the bill would have essentially codified gender-affirming care as an actionable form of abuse, suggesting lawmakers considered parents like Samantha and Brian a danger to their children.Supporters of the bill threw out terms like “mutilation." Meanwhile, a related rally in 2022 attracted members of the white nationalist group the Proud Boys as a national anti-trans movement emerged as a focus of the extremist right in recent years.“It does make you a little nervous,” Brian acknowledged of challenging the state on an issue that has sparked considerable vitriol. “But it does feel a little punk rock. I don’t like what these people are doing, and I want to tell them that.”A few months after the Williamses sued, a Trump-appointed judge in Nashville's federal district court temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing the law. The ruling found the state lacked medical evidence and had likely run afoul of constitutional concerns. Months later, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, siding with Tennessee.The Supreme Court arguments in December will center on that appellate ruling. Tennessee plans to argue the state has a compelling interest in blocking medication from kids who wish to treat their gender dysphoria.Though Justice Department and ACLU lawyers will argue the state's inconsistent ban amounts to sex discrimination, Tennessee argues that the state is allowed to set "age and use-based limits" and that the law does not differentiate between males and females but rather specific usage limits.In December, between her 11th grade classes and social calendar, L will travel to Washington with her family to once again watch a chamber debate her access to medical care."I'm definitely proud of myself for it, but I'm nervous that it's not going to go well. I'm a little nervous that I will feel some responsibility for this case going in front of the Supreme Court," L said. She acknowledged that a ruling in the case could make or break gender-affirming care access for the entire country."I'm not too worried because, well, you've got to be optimistic about these things."

CONTENT: Thanksgiving always falls soon after an election, and in recent years American politics has gained a febrile intensity—making this year's conversation over turkey a potential tinderbox.It feels like there's no escaping politics in America. And perhaps the path to unity is to have these issues out in the open among family and friends so the country can learn once again to disagree agreeably.Or is Thanksgiving a time for setting aside our differences, especially on politics? Maybe it's better to use the holiday as a safe space from partisan and ideological divides, one in which we can reconnect through the things that bind us together, not split us apart.So: Should you talk politics at Thanksgiving? Newsweek put the question to family therapists. Here's what they said.As someone who has worked with couples for over four decades and is in a 50-year bipartisan marriage myself, my answer to the question is simple.If collaborative, loving conversations about politics have been possible in the past, by all means, share your thoughts and opinions. It will foster connection.If not, or if you aren't completely certain about positive outcomes, focus instead on the true meaning of Thanksgiving and ask yourself: "What am I grateful for regarding the people in my family? Despite the fact that we may not see eye-to-eye on many things, what do I love about them? What do I need to do or say today in order to show my family members that I prioritize our relationship and long history rather than focus on our differences? How can I use this family gathering as a means to connect (and heal) rather than to deepen the chasm?"Sometimes, it's important to remember that when it comes to "speaking our truths," less is more. Thanksgiving is that sometime.Thanksgiving is a time to be festive, not to debate.The holidays are meant for joy, gratitude, appreciation, and celebrating what brings us together—not talking about politics that can lead to a clashing of opinions.It is important to go into Thanksgiving with a mindset of avoiding talking about politics and focusing instead on the positivity of being with family, loved ones, and friends.If you are confronted or cornered by a loved one, you can say: "I am interested to hear what you're thinking and happy to share my thoughts at another time, not today."Then change the topic and ask someone to pass the turkey.In the event that differences erupt, if you are hosting, you can gently remind your guests we are here to celebrate and not to discuss our opinions.ABSOLUTELY NOT!Even if you are all on the same page politically, and especially when you're not, this topic arouses a lot of angst, anger, fear, and concern. Give yourself and your family a break.Commit to making it a day of being together in peace and gratitude. If you are not the host, perhaps you can ask the hosts if they would declare the gathering as a politics-free zone.If they are on board, see if they are willing to send a message to all the guests beforehand declaring that the Thanksgiving gathering is a politics-free zone.Or, at the onset of the gathering, say: "We are coming together to eat good food, be together and be happy. No talk of national or international politics please."I think all the guests will be relieved.If a discussion does erupt, the most important thing you can do is "protect your peace, take deep breaths and don't argue back."You can try to change the subject by talking about how delicious the food is or asking for something that's across the table to be passed or shift the conversation by bringing up something you are grateful for.If all else fails, take a break and some long, deep breaths.Most people will tell you that whether to bring up politics at the Thanksgiving table depends on the maturity of the family. (Do they get along? Are they tolerant of differing opinions? Do they ever get violent?)But I have a different take: It depends entirely on your intent.You have to be honest with yourself about what you're after when you bring up politics. What most people aren't willing to admit is that their real purpose for getting political with family members is to convince them of how very wrong their opinion is.If this is your intent, bail. No one wants to be told how uninformed they are, or how ridiculous their sources are. You're likely to be met with defensiveness, stubbornness, or outright anger, and now everyone at the table feels awkward.If you can change your purpose from persuasion to curiosity, you're much more likely to have a pleasant, even fascinating conversation.Instead of entering the discussion with the goal of demonstrating your rightness, make the conversation about the other person. Become very interested in how they came to believe what they believe.When people feel they are truly being listened to, they are surprisingly non-defensive and even vulnerable. You may learn an intimate truth about your loved one that you never knew before. These conversations can be transformative.More than any other time in recent history, couples and families are divided in their loyalties and opinions around politics. We are divided and polarized as a country— Democrats versus Republicans, conservatives against liberals.This year, over the holidays, who we are sharing a meal with and celebrating our togetherness may lead to more than full stomachs—but more separateness and division.In my practice as a therapist, I've seen grown children detach from their parents, couples separate and ask for divorce, and siblings refuse to talk to one another because they voted for different presidents.Political selection is based on many things—who you grew up with, what you have seen in the media, and your intuitive response to a political candidate.Reading about a president's beliefs or a political party's stance on issues on the internet or through social media is much different than working with that person or talking with them directly.We are being taught in our culture now to choose sides and pick a belief system, whether this aligns with our chosen party or our families, or not.Over the holidays, try to come together with loved ones over what you appreciate and what you are grateful for, instead of how you differ.Thanksgiving is not the time to decide your family's loyalties.At least, wait till January.Thanksgiving is traditionally a time to express gratitude, share meals, and strengthen familial bonds. However, introducing political discussions into this space can be a double-edged sword, particularly during polarized times.Whether such conversations enhance connection or create discord depends on a variety of factors, including family dynamics, individual emotional capacity, and the communication styles of those involved.From a family therapy lens, it's important to weigh the risks and benefits while cultivating mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and healthy boundaries.For individuals who feel deeply connected to their values and moral compass, political discussions can provide a meaningful opportunity to express authenticity and engage in purposeful dialogue.Ensuring that conversations align with your integrity and beliefs is key to fostering self-respect and connection. Speaking your truth does not require confrontation or judgment of others but rather the courage to share your perspective with kindness, clarity, and respect for the humanity of those who may hold differing views.For example, a family member who is passionate about environmental activism might share, "One thing I'm really grateful for this year is the progress we've made in raising awareness about climate change. It's a cause close to my heart, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can all make a difference, even in small ways."By framing the discussion in a positive and collaborative way, the person creates space for dialogue without alienating others or inciting conflict.In dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), dichotomous (all-or-nothing) thinking is recognized as a cognitive distortion that exacerbates conflict by reinforcing rigid viewpoints.For example, viewing family members as either "right" or "wrong" can create division and intensify disagreements. This type of thinking may lead to escalation of conflict, emotional burnout, and rigid boundaries that prevent growth or connection.A more balanced perspective involves recognizing nuance and cultivating empathy. By embracing balance, we can approach differing opinions with curiosity rather than defensiveness, fostering mutual respect and understanding.Ultimately, there is no universal "right" or "wrong" answer to whether families should discuss politics at Thanksgiving. Each family must assess their unique dynamics, history, and emotional resilience.For some, these discussions may foster connection and growth. For others, they may introduce unnecessary stress or conflict.By cultivating mindfulness, respecting boundaries, and embracing a balanced perspective, families can navigate these conversations in ways that honor both individuality and togetherness.Thanksgiving provides an opportunity to celebrate shared values and build deeper bonds. Whether or not politics is part of the conversation, the goal remains the same: To foster gratitude, connection, and mutual respect.Updated, 11/27/25, 14:45 p.m. ET: A comment by Angela Caldwell was added.Shane Croucher is a Senior Editor based in London, UK.

CONTENT: B
ook bans are skyrocketing in America, finds a new report from PEN America, a non-profit organization that champions free expression in writing. During the 2023-24 school year, over 10,000 books were banned across the country, more than double the number that were banned the prior year.Those in favor of bans argue that books depicting LGBTQ+ characters, gender diversity, sexuality, and racism are unsuitable for children. Working together, conservative pressure groups and politicians have successfully banned a historic number of books across the nation. The number is expected to increase in 2025.In July alone, Utah enacted a bill to create a “no read list” across the state, while Florida enacted a sweeping bill giving parents the power to veto books in public schools and libraries. More recently, a large county school board in Tennessee voted to ban six books from public libraries, including Beloved by Toni Morrison.Book bans may have mushroomed in the Trump era of reactionary politics, but they have a well-established history in America. Battles over what books can be read, and by whom, dating back to the ban on Uncle Tom’s Cabin by abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1852, reflect larger political battles over America’s moral and cultural values.Women have been powerful drivers of book controversies. One woman in particular, Norma Gabler, re-defined the current strategy and logic behind modern book bans. Called “education’s public enemy number one,” by critics in 1980, Gabler led the crusade against the so-called secular trend in school textbooks throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Even though Norma and her husband Mel worked together, Norma was the public face of their efforts for decades.Read More: Why All 3 NYC Library Systems Are Standing Against CensorshipIt all began in 1961 in Longview, Texas, when Gabler’s son presented his school textbook and pointed out that the words “one nation under God” were missing from the Gettysburg Address.“Well, I’m Irish, and that got my Irish up,” Gabler reported in a 1982 article.Angered by what she considered a factual and moral omission, Gabler, a devout Baptist, drove nearly five hours to Austin, the state capital, to complain to the State Board of Education.After her trip to Austin, Gabler’s activism snowballed. She began regularly raising objections at the Texas textbook committee hearings, which advised the state’s Board of Education on which textbooks to adopt. It wasn’t until 1974, over a decade after she began, that she saw the fruits of her labor. That year, science textbooks contained a notice stating that evolution was a theory, not a fact. Her persistence, and ability to rally other Christian women to complain at committee hearings, had finally started to pay off.At the same time as Gabler, other American women—from the left and the right—led disputes over educational material. In West Virginia, mother and school board member Alice Moore protested textbooks she considered anti-American, anti-God, and anti-white. Over the course of a year, thousands of other parents and organizations joined Moore’s protests, which eventually turned violent. Elsewhere, second-wave feminists argued that schools needed to rid curricula of gender stereotypes, and that women’s accomplishments ought to be more prominently cited in history books.Norma and Mel Gabler went on to sway which books Texas adopted for the public-school curriculum. At the time, Texas was the largest textbook buyer in the nation and books for the entire state were selected centrally by the State Board of Education. As such, publishers relied on the Gablers’ evaluation of textbooks for sales. Because the Texas market was so big, other states also adopted their approved textbooks, meaning Texas—­and the Gablers—often decided the curriculum for other states too.  The material Norma Gabler opposed included what she deemed “gutter language,” “secular humanism,” evolution, women’s liberation, and socialism. She advocated for the free market and Christianity. At the same time, other right-wing Christian women across the nation also became politically mobilized. They sought to curb the erosion of so-called Christian values from different areas of American culture, including education, television and movies, and books.In California, Beverly LaHaye launched an organization to combat feminism, Phyllis Schlafly campaigned to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, Anita Bryant went to war against gay rights, and Dr. Mildred Jefferson rallied against abortion. These women, and others, operated independently, yet labored toward a common goal: to protect conservative Christian values, which they felt were under attack.Even though she rose to the forefront of America’s educational politics, Gabler endorsed traditional gender roles and wanted to see this reflected in school textbooks. She consistently referred to herself as “just a housewife and mother” without a college degree. Gabler framed book censorship as a matter of “parental rights.” Once, during a heated face-off with a State Board of Education member, Norma asserted: “My sons belong to us; they do not belong to you and the state ­– yet.” Similarly, giving a public talk to parents, she passionately stated: “If you don’t fight, nobody else will!”Read More: Parents Should Have a Voice in Their Kids' Education But We've Gone Too FarHer emphasis on being an everyday concerned mother was a political strategy that aided her success. Precisely because she was described as “plain folk” from small-town Texas, Gabler’s activism was difficult to counter. Additionally, by staking her politics on her identity as a mother, she and other right-wing activists such as Schlafly and LaHaye, appealed to other Christian women, drawing them into the political fray.In 1973, the Gablers founded Educational Research Analysts, a non-profit organization. They hired six staff members who helped them review textbooks and disseminate regular newsletters with their findings to a mailing list of over 10,000 people. That year also marked a turning point as the Gablers achieved a broader, more national influence, leading seminars on textbook evaluation for conservative groups across the U.S. During the 1970s and 1980s, Gabler lectured before various audiences about textbook monitoring, from women’s organizations to government bodies. She appeared on national television, including on CBS 60 Minutes, and radio shows. In 1985, the Gablers published a book called What Are they Teaching Our Children?, which detailed the ruinous effects of secular textbooks.Today, America’s book bans have changed slightly. As literature has expanded to include more stories about gender and racial diversity, conservative women have also adapted their political targets. Whereas Gabler targeted school textbooks, pressure groups and politicians currently focus on literature­ such as Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, the most challenged book of last year.Norma Gabler’s objections spanned various topics, and often centered on factual inaccuracies, not just moral debates. Today, bans center entirely on upholding conservative Christian values. Even still, the topics under attack reflect historical antecedents. Books featuring LGTBQ+ relationships are the most heavily targeted, recalling Bryant’s virulent attack on gay rights in 1977.And whereas Gabler waged ideological battle with the state’s public education system, today’s battles have expanded to include public libraries as well.Despite these differences, much of the same rhetoric persists. As Gabler argued 60 years ago, today’s book banners continue to emphasize that parents hold the right to decide what their children read and learn about. This logic finds purchase during periods of marked social and cultural change. Just like the early 1970s, today’s politics are characterized by an intense moral backlash, and parents—­more specifically mothers—strive to protect the established moral order.Gabler’s legacy lives on in Florida’s House Bill 1069, which mentions “parents’ rights” six times. And Donald Trump’s campaign promise to abolish the Department of Education rests on the reasoning that parents—not the federal government—should govern all aspects of children’s education.Moms for Liberty, which claims to have 130,000 members in chapters across 48 states, is a driving force behind recent book bans in America. Led by Tiffany Justice and Tina Descovich, the group stresses parents’ right to choose what their children read, just like Norma Gabler did decades ago. And just like Gabler, Justice and Descovich present themselves as everyday “moms on a mission.”They have been highly effective. The recent Moms for Liberty annual conference, headlined by Donald Trump, focused on education, alongside gender identity. As Gabler once exhorted her audience of conservative women: “Let’s show them that we know how to win!”As U.S. politics grow ever more contentious and the conservative backlash mounts, it is prudent to remember that the battle over books is nothing new. And that sometimes the most unsuspecting actors wield tremendous political power.Katie Gaddini is a Visiting Researcher at Stanford University, History Department, and Associate Professor of Sociology at University College London (UCL).

CONTENT: Glenn Jacobs, the former WWE star once known as Kane and who now serves as mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, says he would tell Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson: don't get into politics.In a recent appearance on "Going Ringside," Jacobs was asked about the prospect of Johnson – a fellow WWE icon as well as Hollywood A-lister, and TKO board member – venturing into politics."If I'm him, I wouldn't. Politics is incredibly contentious and toxic right now," Jacobs stated. "Everybody likes Dwayne, no matter where you are on the political spectrum, because he's a great entertainer, and he's a good guy."More News: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Reveals Future WWE PlansFor years, there have been rumors that Johnson is considering a move into politics. Last year, he confirmed that multiple political parties had approached him about running for U.S. president, following a poll that showed 46% of Americans would support his candidacy."That was an interesting poll that happened and I was really moved by that," Johnson said. "I'll share this little bit with you: at the end of the year in 2022, I got a visit from the parties asking me if I was going to run and if I could run...It was all very surreal because that's never been my goal. My goal has never been to be in politics. As a matter of fact, there's a lot about politics that I hate."Despite his claims, Johnson has previously said that he "can't deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring" and that the (then-future) 2024 presidential election was a possibility, at least in the abstract.However, a WWE Hall of Famer wants him to sidestep that possibility. Jacobs, best known as Kane, enjoyed a long wrestling career. After debuting in 1997, he won the WWE Championship (1x), World Heavyweight Championship (1x), and multiple Tag Team Championships. Kane is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion and a winner of the 2001 Royal Rumble. Known for his sinister, masked persona and as The Undertaker's brother, Kane became a cornerstone of WWE's storytelling for decades.More News: Dwayne Johnson Admits To Surprising On-Set PracticeNow, the politician says that Johnson will basically destroy his fanbase by entering politics."[You've] got to remember that no matter what you say in politics, 50% of the people are just going to knee-jerk disagree with you," Jacobs said. "You're going to really tick some folks off. I've had to deal with that, obviously. If I were him, I would advise him not to do that, personally."We may see the Rock in the White House someday, but Kane just can't support it.For more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.Nathan Kamal is a Chicago-based writer and fan of the Cubs.

CONTENT: Sarah McBride is set to be the first openly transgender woman to serve in Congress after she was elected to represent Delaware's at-large congressional district this month.Having entered politics at a young age, McBride has spent her career campaigning for expanding access to affordable healthcare, advocating gun reforms and supporting anti-discrimination legislation in Delaware to protect trans people.But the 34-year-old already finds herself in the firing line from Republicans on Capitol Hill, with GOP Congresswoman Nancy Mace filing a bill seeking to ban transgender women from using the women's bathroom at the U.S. Capitol.Newsweek has reached out to Rep.-elect Sarah McBride and Rep. Nancy Mace for comment via email.McBride is the member-elect for Delaware's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.She previously served as a Democratic state senator in Delaware since November 2020. She is the highest-ranking transgender elected official in United States history and the first openly transgender member of the United States Congress.But even before her career in professional politics, McBride was a trailblazer. The year before she graduated, she became the first trans woman to intern at the White House, and in 2016, she was the first trans person to speak at the Democratic National Convention. The Wilmington native publicly came out as a transgender woman at 21 through her university's student newspaper and a viral Facebook post.Meanwhile, she is also credited with helping shape President Joe Biden's support for LGBTQ rights.But despite her accomplishments, McBride told Reuters news agency she wanted the focus of her campaign to be on the issues she would strive to change, rather than the historic nature of her candidacy."Whenever you are first, you often have to try to be the best version that you can," she said, acknowledging the "added responsibilities" she feels she has."But none of them matter if I don't fulfil the responsibility of just being the best member of Congress that I can be for Delaware."Nonetheless, her election comes as transgender issues increasingly form part of the national political conversation. Nearly half of states, controlled by Republicans have banned gender-affirming care for minors or barred transgender students from sports leagues aligned with their identity. Conversely, 15 Democratic controlled states have enacted "shield" laws to protect access to gender-affirming care.Over 60 percent of Americans oppose laws banning gender-affirming care for minors while well over 30 percent support them, according to a Gallup poll in May, 2024.One such issue that Republicans have focused on has been bathroom access for transgender people.And McBride may be forced to confront this issue on her first day of Congress in January after Rep. Nancy Mace put forward a two-page resolution which would prohibit House members and staffers from "using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex."The measure covers bathrooms in the Capitol and House offices, charging the House sergeant-at-arms with enforcing the prohibition.The measure has been supported by other house republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. During a GOP conference on Wednesday, Johnson said "there's not going to be any biological men using our restrooms," according to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.Mace is reportedly trying to get the bill included in the rules for the 119th Congress or have it voted on separately. She said that if her bill fails to pass this year, she will "file this again next congressional session."Speaking about the measure, Mace told journalist Pablo Manríquez on Monday: "Sarah McBride doesn't get a say in this. If you're a biological man, you shouldn't be in women's restrooms.""This is the last war on women and I aim to stop it," she added.Later asked on Tuesday if her bill deliberately targeted McBride, Mace said "Yes and absolutely, and then some.""I'm absolutely 100 percent gonna stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women's restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms. I will be there fighting you every step of the way," she added.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also said she supported the measure, and referred to McBride as "a man," and "he" multiple times. "I support a resolution that keeps all biological men out of women's bathrooms, locker rooms, and private places. Not only here in the Capitol complex, our office buildings, but all taxpayer-funded facilities," she said in a video posted to X.Greene was then asked how one would "check if someone is qualified to use the ladies' restroom? Obviously there's a new transgender member of Congress.""Which is a man," said Greene. "He's a man. He's a biological male. So he is not allowed to use our women's restrooms, our women's gym, our locker rooms and spaces that are specified for women."He's a biological male," Greene continued. "He's got plenty of places he can go."Greene was also asked whether "they should make gender-neutral bathrooms.""No," Greene responded. "He can go in the men's room and he has a bathroom in his office just like all of us do."She added: "I use the restroom most of the time in my office. He has a bathroom that will be designated for him."Mace did not answer questions about how one would check who is qualified to use female or male restrooms. "Here's the deal. Biological men shouldn't be in women's private spaces, period. End of story," she responded. "It's time to make sure that we protect women and girls everywhere."In a 2022 Pew Research Center poll, around four in 10 Americans said transgender people should be required to use public bathrooms "that match the sex they were assigned at birth."Multiple studies and reviews have found no evidence to support the claim that transgender women or individuals pose an increased threat to safety in bathrooms.Following the remarks, McBride provided Newsweek with a statement."This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing," she said."We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars. Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible and that's what I'm focused on," she added.Other Democrats have also condemned the measure. "The cruelty is the point," Rep. Becca Balint, a co-chair of the Equality Caucus, said."Is that what we want the sergeant-at-arms to be doing when we had an attack on the freaking Capitol?""What they are talking about there on day one is where one member out of 435... is going to use the bathroom," said Rep. Katherine Clark. "That is their focus."Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez added: "This is not just bigotry, this is just plain bullying."Transgender issues increasingly form part of the national political conversation, with Donald Trump and the Republicans frequently trying to capitalize on the debate.During the election campaign, the president-elect targeted Democrats on transgender issues with a flurry of ads that became widespread by Election Day. One ad featured the message, "Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you," referencing the use of "they" and "them" as pronouns. The 30-second spot was part of a broader $215 million in anti-transgender advertising by Trump and Republicans, according to the tracking firm AdImpact.Following Trump's victory, Democrats have been left torn over how to handle transgender politics going forward. "There are just a number of issues where we're out of touch," said Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, who has sparked fierce criticism from within his own party for saying in the wake of the election that he didn't want his daughters playing in sports against biological males.Once in power, Trump and other Republicans who will hold majorities in both the House and Senate — have vowed to roll back protections and civil liberties for trans people.A post-election survey by AP found that 55 percent of all Americans—and 85 percent of Trump voters—feel government support for transgender rights has gone too far.McBride herself has hit back at Trump and Republicans for their focus on transgender issues, saying they are "trying to divide and distract" voters."The party that was focused on culture wars, the party that was focused on trans people was the Republican Party," McBride told reporters on Capitol Hill after her victory. "It was Donald Trump," she added, who "was trying to divide and distract from the fact that he has absolutely no policy solutions for the issues that are actually keeping voters up at night."Update 11/20/24, 03:30 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Sarah McBride.Martha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on U.S. politics and society.

HEADER: https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/jazz-legend-wynton-marsalis-says-american-democracy-in-swing/

CONTENT: As it turns out, “it don’t mean a thing unless you’ve got that swing” applies to global politics as well as music. At Fortune’s Global Forum conference on Monday in New York City, Wynton Marsalis, trumpeter legend and director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, spoke about the state of America post election, drawing parallels between politics and music. He added like Jazz, U.S. democracy is always “in swing.” “Swing is the constant reconciliation of opposites,” he says. “It’s a constant attempt to find the balance of opposing forces.”The recent presidential race brought those opposites starkly into the foreground, with different policy proposals from both parties on everything from immigration, abortion rights, and the economy. After Trump was announced the next president of the U.S. last week, many citizens were split between feeling cheerful or disappointed. Marsalis says that the momentum of politics, just like jazz music, is subjective to the individual. “What I’m describing is a momentum, and the momentum goes well or not based on your perspective,” he says. “For some people it’s going well. For others, it’s not.”Marsalis used jazz musicians as an example of how politicians or voters might be at risk of thinking, trapped in their own echo chambers of thought. He says that a very loud drummer may believe everything is going great, because all he can hear is the thumping of his instrument. A base player might ramp up their amp to the max, and be of the mindset that the sound is exactly what they wanted. But just like government officials or citizens, they can get lost in their own perspective.The music has no set leader, pattern, rhythm, or flow—so the musicians constantly have to negotiate amongst themselves to get the right tune. Politicians should have to do the same to best serve the needs of others, according to Marsalis. “Democracy has no king. Because you don’t have a king, and we have to figure out how to negotiate in space,” he says. “Democracy has the element of choice. You can choose to expend as much of your energy as you can extend on the rights of others, or you can extend it all for yourself.

77,162,989 votes (49.9%)US President-elect Donald Trump has announced his campaign manager, Susan Summerall Wiles, will serve as his White House chief of staff when he takes over the presidency next year.In a statement, Trump said that Wiles "just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history" and "is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected"."It is a well deserved honour to have Susie as the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history," he continued. "I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”Wiles, 67, is the first woman to be appointed White House chief of staff.The Trump transition team is currently working to choose top members of the incoming Republican administration, including the heads of all 15 executive departments, such as the secretaries of state and defence, from 20 January.In his victory speech this week, Trump referred to Wiles as "the ice maiden" as she stood behind him on stage.She operates mostly “in the back”, the president-elect said, but she is known as one of the most feared political operatives in the US."Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again," he added in his statement on Thursday, referring to his oft-repeated campaign slogan.A profile by Politico earlier this year described Susie Wiles as feared but little known.Less than a year after Wiles started working in politics, she joined Ronald Reagan’s campaign ahead of his 1980 election.She went on to play a key role in transforming politics in Florida, where she lives.In 2010, she turned Rick Scott, a then-businessman with little political experience, into Florida’s governor in just seven months. Scott is now a US senator.Wiles met Trump during the 2015 Republican presidential primary and became the co-chair of his Florida campaign. He went on to win the state over Hillary Clinton in 2016.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who put her in charge of his successful gubernatorial race two years later, described Wiles as “the best in the business”.Wiles worked on the Trump campaign alongside Chris LaCivita, a veteran of Republican politics with decades of experience.The two worked with Trump to formulate a winning presidential primary strategy.In her Politico profile, the 67-year-old grandmother - who is the daughter of late American football player and broadcaster Pat Summerall - said that she comes from a "traditional" political background.“In my early career things like manners mattered and there was an expected level of decorum," she said, describing the Republican party as significantly different than the one of several decades ago."And so I get it that the GOP of today is different," she said, referring to the Republican Party, who are also called the Grand Old Party (GOP)."There are changes we must live with in order to get done the things we’re trying to do."The chief of staff is considered to be the president's top aide, and plays a crucial role in every president's administration.They essentially serve as the manager of the White House and are responsible for putting together a president's staff. A chief leads the staff through the Executive Office of the President and oversees all daily operations and staff activities.They also advise presidents on policy issues and are responsible for directing and overseeing policy development.Trump's latest picks include a former NFL player, a House legislator, and Wall Street financer to lead housing, labour, and the treasury.The billionaire donated millions to President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election campaign this year.A former national security adviser, Keith Kellogg has expressed concern for US support for Ukraine.The cases have been dismissed "without prejudice", meaning charges could be refiled when Trump leaves office.Long-time Trump aide Boris Epshteyn has been accused of profiting from influencing cabinet picks.

HEADER: https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/11/the-brain-drain-in-american-politics/680576/

CONTENT: Americans have been jaded about their leaders for decades.This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic’s archives to contextualize the present, surface delightful treasures, and examine the American idea.“It’s very easy to get jaded about politics today … Poll after poll shows a dyspeptic public that hates Congress, disdains politics, and has little faith in government to fix anything.” This observation, which could’ve been written today, was made by the Atlantic staff writer David A. Graham in February 2015, in a story about America’s dire lack of talented and experienced politicians. He traced this problem back to 1955, when former Senator Joseph S. Clark Jr. wrote in The Atlantic that “we have too much mediocrity in the business of running the government of the country.”During this election cycle, voters and pundits alike grumbled about the options before them. A 2023 survey of American adults found that 84 percent of respondents think there is a leadership crisis in the U.S. government. Early exit polling from CNN revealed that 64 percent of Trump voters feel dissatisfied or angry with “the way things are going” in the United States. I spoke with David recently to ask him how much of his argument has held up a decade later, and how much has changed.A Governance ProblemStephanie Bai: In 2015, you wrote about the issue of mediocrity in politics—specifically, how our politicians don’t seem to be the best and brightest minds that our populace has to offer. Almost a decade later, how do you think that argument has aged?David A. Graham: The problem is much, much worse. Shortly after this article was published, Donald Trump started running for president. I think he’s a good example of some of the things I wrote about before: He is very good at running for office, but a disaster in terms of governing because he doesn’t understand how the system works.He’s also worsened a lot of the issues that I was thinking about then. His second term may produce a renaissance in hard-right political thought, and it will likely also accelerate most of the governance problems we see now. We’ve seen an exodus of experienced, serious policy makers who are disgusted with the state of things. They know they can’t get anything done, and they think that some people in Congress are kind of clowns. So instead of getting better people in office, we’re getting brain drain.Stephanie: What do you think needs to be done to retain the talent in politics?David: It feels like a vicious cycle. I mean, who wants to be a politician right now? It must take a lot of ego, and a lot of masochism. As long as you have Marjorie Taylor Greene as one of the most prominent members in Congress, you’re not going to attract people who are more serious and can instill a better culture.One precedent we could look at is the post-Watergate moment, when there was a huge loss of faith in the government. You saw a crop of young Democrats who ran for office with big dreams of reform, and many of them stuck around for a very long time in Congress as serious policy makers. Maybe our current political crisis will produce something like that. But Watergate was a more contained crisis of the executive branch; what we see now is dysfunction across the legislative and executive branches, which is harder to break out of.Stephanie: That reminds me of a recent story you wrote about politicians in Ohio, in which you noted that some local leaders “find their paths to higher office blocked by the country’s hyper-partisanship.”David: If you look at the people working in local offices, it’s often a different kind of politician. When I talked to mayors in Ohio for this story, something that came up repeatedly was how often they spend time on things that are not especially partisan. Paving roads is nonpartisan. Cleaning up after storms is nonpartisan. These are things that have to get done. The question is: How do people like that rise higher?The best-case scenario I heard is that if you have really good mayors who are schooled in that pragmatic, consensus-building style, maybe as they move up the political ladder, you’ll see an improvement in our political culture. But that outcome remains to be seen, because they usually end up in these hyper-partisan statewide races—which are hard to win without becoming hyper-partisan.Stephanie: Do you think this election has upended or complicated any conventional wisdom about what makes a politician successful?David: One thing that I’ve been thinking about is the role of people such as Elon Musk, who has discovered that by owning X, contributing a ton of money to Trump, and controlling systems that are necessary to the federal government, like SpaceX, he can give himself something like political power without ever having to run for office. When our political systems start to slide toward dysfunction, people like Musk can emerge, and they can find ways to have a lot of power over citizens but not face any kind of accountability.Read David’s 2015 story here.More StoriesSix Stories on Love and FamilyThe Secrets to a Successful Potluck Dish

CONTENT: Independence campaigners have hailed "a revolution in Texas politics" after 10 Republicans who have committed to supporting a referendum on secession from the United States were elected to the state legislature.According to the secessionist Texas Nationalist Movement, the 10 politicians, all of whom won seats in the Texas House of Representatives, were signatories to its "Texas First Pledge." Signatories of the pledge have vowed to "vote for legislation and resolutions to call for a vote on Texas reasserting its status as an independent nation" and to "work toward a fair and expedient separation of Texas from the federal government" if this referendum is won.Texas nationalists wish to take the Lone Star State out of the union and create a fully independent country. Before joining the United States, the Republic of Texas existed as an independent nation from 1836 to 1846. A poll of 814 eligible Texan voters conducted earlier this year for Newsweek found that 33 percent supported secession, while 39 percent were opposed, with the remainder either neutral or unsure. However, in a hypothetical referendum, 67 percent said they would vote for Texas to remain a state within the United States.On Wednesday, in a statement released on Facebook, the TNM said: "The establishment said it couldn't be done. Last night, Texas First champions DOMINATED races across the Lone Star State!"The voice of Texas independence just got a whole lot louder. From the halls of the Legislature to local courthouses, supporters of the Texas First Pledge secured victories that will reshape our state's political landscape.""This isn't just a victory—it's a revolution in Texas politics," it added. "The old guard's lies about supporting a TEXIT vote making a candidate 'unelectable' were shattered last night."In March 2023, a Republican state representative introduced the Texas Independence Referendum Act to the Texas House, calling for a referendum on "whether or not the state should investigate the possibility of Texas independence." The legislation failed to pass the committee stage.Speaking to Newsweek, TNM President Daniel Miller said he expected similar legislation to be proposed by one of the lawmakers elected on Tuesday who signed the Texas First Pledge."This next session will likely see the Texas Independence Referendum Act filed again," he said. "However, we'll be advocating for and working with legislators on a whole host of policy initiatives involving the border, currency and more. All of this is because the closer we can move Texas to structurally and operationally functioning like an independent nation, the easier separation becomes once we get and win the TEXIT referendum."Miller added that this was part of a process in which the TNM sought "political, cultural, and economic independence" for Texas."This means that while we work to get and win a referendum on independence, we also work on policy initiatives that move Texas closer to independence. Strategically, anything that closes the gap between where we are and Texas being a fully self-governing independent nation is part of the TEXIT process," he said.According to the TNM, the 10 Texas First Pledge signatories elected on Tuesday were David Lowe in House District 91, Shelley Luther in District 62, Keresa Richardson in District 61, Brent Money in District 2, A.J. Louderback in District 30, Wesley Virdell in District 53, Janis Holt in District 18, Andy Hopper in District 64, Steve Toth in District 15 and Mitch Little in District 65.Earlier this year, Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told Newsweek he doubted Texan independence could be achieved peacefully.He said: "I think history has made clear that there is no plausible scenario in which Texas could peacefully extract itself from the United States, even were that the will of its populous—which there is no indication of to my knowledge."Newsweek Is Committed To Journalism That'S Factual And Fair.Hold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.James Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is covering U.S. politics and world ... read more

CONTENT: Voters had the chance this election to break the highest glass ceiling in American politics by electing Kamala Harris the nation’s first female president. Instead, they returned Donald Trump to the White House, a comeback that relied on significant -- even somewhat improved – support among women.Some female voters on Wednesday mourned the missed opportunity to send a woman to the Oval Office and wondered when, if ever, it might happen.“I am just aghast,” said Precious Brady-Davis, a Black transgender woman who’d just won a two-year term on a Chicago-area water management board — but her joy in that was tempered. “I am disappointed in my fellow Americans that, once again, we did not elect a qualified woman to the presidency.”Precious Brady-Davis, a Black transgender woman who’d just won a two-year term on a Chicago-area water management board, speaks during an interview Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Erin Hooley)Those who supported Trump — like Katherine Mickelson, a 20-year-old college student from Sioux Falls, South Dakota — said the race came down to values and to issues like the economy, not gender. Even Harris herself sought her place in history without dwelling on her gender.“While I think a lot of women would like to see a female president, myself included,” Mickelson said, “we aren’t just going to blindly vote for a woman.”Despite the history-making potential of Harris’ campaign, she wasn’t able to expand on President Joe Biden’s 2020 support among women to cement a win, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Fifty-three percent of women supported Harris, compared with 46% for Trump — slightly narrower than Biden’s advantage among them in 2020.Supporters react as they watch election results at an election night campaign watch party for Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)The prospect of electing the first female president didn’t rank high as a motivator for voters. Only about 1 in 10 voters said the fact that Harris would be the first woman was the single most important factor for their vote, while about one-quarter said it was an important driver, but not the most important.Denise Martin in Georgia had a grim view: “I really feel like the majority of Americans still aren’t ready for a woman. They are so short-sighted.” That included, she said, some fellow female voters.People giving their first names Erika, left, and Leeann react after an abortion rights amendment to the Missouri constitution passed, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, at a watch party in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)Women were more likely than men to say electing the first female president was at least a factor in their vote, VoteCast showed, though few said it was the main driver and about 4 in 10 women said it wasn’t a factor.Black women were especially motivated by the potential for the first female president — about a third said it was the most important factor.Maya Davis theorized that Harris’ identity as a Black and South Asian woman “absolutely” played a role in her defeat. As a Black woman herself, the 27-year-old North Carolina attorney said she’s constantly forced to prove herself.“I don’t think there’s anything she could have done differently unfortunately,” she said of Harris. “Maybe not be a woman.”Female supporters of Trump, 78 — who adopted a hypermasculine campaign style, used sexist tropes and vowed to protect women “whether they like it or not” — said they found his rhetoric perhaps unfortunate or hyperbolic, but less troubling than concerns about the economy, immigration and abortion.Krissy Bunner of Greenville, South Carolina, called Trump a “promoter of women” and said the future is “so much brighter” for them because Trump was elected.“He does so much, you know, for us,” the 56-year-old said. She described women who favored Harris as misled by the media, and said Trump’s stringent border policies and stance on barring transgender athletes from women’s sports would benefit all women.Virginia King, 19, of Dallas, spoke about Trump’s unscripted nature. “He’s just kind of outspoken about what he thinks and what he does, whereas other people hide it,” she said. “It’s probably not ideal, but it doesn’t make me not support him.”Voters wait in line to cast their ballots outside a polling station on the Navajo Nation in Chinle, Ariz., on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Andres Leighton)Other women found the former president’s bombast ominous and feared a second Trump term would further threaten their rights two years after his Supreme Court appointees helped overturn the right to abortion.“All of women’s protections are going to go away if you don’t protect the basic fundamental issue of democracy to begin with,” said retired teacher Mary Ellen Brown, 66, of Newtown, Pennsylvania. Brown said she dressed in black Wednesday and feared her family was losing faith in their country.After Harris stepped into the race in July, Trump doubled down on banter that many found paternalistic – and worse — as he tried to close the gender gap. He also offended many by calling Harris “stupid” or “lazy.” His running mate, JD Vance, called the vice president “trash.”The discourse didn’t bother Nina Christina, a North Carolina nurse more worried about feeding her children. Christina, 35, voted for Trump and said she just hopes to avoid being “underwater.”“It shouldn’t be this difficult to survive in everyday life,” said Christina, adding that Harris already had a chance to fix the economy.Voters cast ballots in Denver on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Chet Stgrange)Harris, 60, bypassed the suffragist white worn by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and rarely spoke about the glass ceiling during a frenzy of energetic campaign stops since becoming the Democratic nominee in July.Her supporters welcomed the upbeat mood after what they saw as a series of setbacks for women’s progress in recent years: a workload surge during the pandemic, when children were sent home from school in 2020; the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022; and the steady drumbeat of #MeToo cases, some lodged against Trump.In Minneapolis, 90-year-old Audrey Wesley -- who’s voted in more presidential elections than she can count off the top of her head -- said she’d been hoping a Harris victory would usher in a bipartisan resurgence.“I can’t believe a man that has done this much against the law can even be running for president,” Wesley said, referring to the litany of legal battles, including sexual assault allegations, Trump brings to the office. “Our system is broken.”Voters fill out their ballots at a voting center at Lumen Field Event Center on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)Relatively few voters said Trump’s legal cases were a major factor in their decision-making this election, according to AP VoteCast. Only about a quarter of Trump voters said the legal cases involving Trump were at least an important factor, but about 8 in 10 Harris voters did.Some women voters experienced the gender gap within their own homes or families — women like Dee Bertino, 55, of Moorestown, New Jersey, who spent her first date with her husband arguing about trickle-down economics. Twenty-five years and two sons later, she mailed in a ballot for Harris while her husband voted for Trump.Bertino said her top concern was women’s rights, but she also bemoaned the lack of civility she felt Trump had unleashed. Her husband, Bob, 58, with whom she runs a sexual health company, also supported abortion rights, she said, but felt the economy, immigration and other issues were more important.Having a woman president is “not that big” for me, Bertino said. “But I truly believe that our democracy is facing its largest threat in history, and Trump must be stopped.”First-time voter Elizabeth Vazquez, 33, left, receives in-person assistance from her mother, Estela Gonzalez, middle, and Victoria Arriaga, as she casts her ballot at Barrio Action Youth & Family Center in the El Sereno area of Los Angeles on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)Bertino and her husband hotly debate politics and the election. That’s not true for Martin, in Peachtree City, Georgia,Martin, 61, is a flight attendant. Her partner is a pilot. He voted for Trump, for the third time. She voted for Harris. Speaking about politics is fraught and painful, and they know to avoid it.When Clinton lost in 2016, Martin said, she was beside herself and couldn’t talk to her partner for days. This year, Martin had hoped to privately celebrate the ascension of the first female president, a woman she supported not because she was a woman, but because she was the right candidate: “so thoughtful, so smart, so well-spoken.”But the news did not seem good, so she went to bed. She awoke to see the race called for Trump, and grew tearful. Among her chief concerns: the future of democracy; health care, especially reproductive care for young women; respect for science; climate policy; and the United States’ standing in the world.As Clinton herself has said, Harris didn’t need to emphasize the gender issue, because the public has grown more accustomed to seeing female candidates.

Terrill)”We now don’t just have one image of a person who happens to be a woman who ran for president – namely me,” she told the AP in September. “Now we have a much better opportunity for women candidates, starting with Kamala, to be viewed in a way that just takes for granted the fact that, yes, guess what? She’s a woman.”Annita Lentin of West Hollywood, Calif., walks through the Connie Norman Transgender Empowerment Center after casting her ballot at a polling place there on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in West Hollywood, Calif. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)Trump voter Elizabeth Herbert, a retired homeschool teacher from Wake Forest, North Carolina, saw Trump as a strong leader and family man. She would still like to see a woman president. She just didn’t embrace Harris.“I think a woman could do a great job as president,” she said. “I don’t think she is the right woman.”Some women who’d voted for Harris told AP they were too stunned to speak about the news. “I’m devastated,” texted one; “I’ll need a little time,” another wrote. Others said they were forcing themselves to move forward.“We’ll get through today and then get some rest,” Martin said, looking forward to playing trivia with her friends later.“The world is going to change, but we have to find our way in it. We can’t let this ruin us.”Associated Press reporters Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City; Makiya Seminera in Raleigh, North Carolina; Sophia Tareen in Chicago; Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia; and Michael Goldberg in Minneapolis contributed.

CONTENT: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. − Donald Trump continues to redefine what is possible in American politics.Impeached twice. Convicted of 34 felony counts. Ejected from the White House four years ago.And yet Americans not only voted to send Trump back on Tuesday, they backed him more decisively against Vice President Kamala Harris than his 2016 upset over Hillary Clinton.Even Trump was left marveling at one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history."Look what happened – is this crazy?" Trump told a screaming crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center early Wednesday.Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.The former president captured battleground states that for weeks had been considered a toss-up. The race was both improbable and historic.Former Trump officials – including his vice president and military leaders – had warned against another Trump presidency.Charges are still pending against him on accusations of trying to overturn the 2020 election.Trump also survived two assassination attempts and overcame any concerns voters may have had about electing a 78-year-old man to the highest office in the land after he refused to disclose the kind of health details other presidential candidates have routinely shared.Supporters gathered in South Florida as the returns came in were awed at how far Trump has come.Stephen Hamilton, 58, a businessman who said he flew to Palm Beach County from his home in New Jersey to be part of history, said he viewed Trump as a very tough guy.“Resilient,” Hamilton said.Blake Marnell, 60, a salesman from San Diego who has attended dozens of Trump rallies in a suit illustrated to look like stacked bricks, said Trump will now have a decades-long influence on the Republican Party and American politics in general."His success will galvanize other politicians," said the man whom Trump has called "Brick Suit."Some supporters saw a spiritual element in Trump's victory."It was very emotional - very, very emotional," said Rose Roque, 84, a retiree from Miami Lakes. "God is taking care of him."The sound system at the watch party alternated between '70s and '80s rock and TV news broadcasts of election returns. The escalating cheers of the crowd hit a crescendo at 1:47 a.m. EST when Fox News projected that Trump had won enough electoral votes to capture the presidency a second time.Some Trump supporters said the night reminded them of his 2016 victory over Clinton, the former secretary of state.Others said there is no comparison."I don't think it's reminiscent of anything," said Hogan Gidley, a media spokesman in Trump's first White House. "This is the most unbelievable, most improbable comeback story in the history of American politics."Trump becomes the first president since Grover Cleveland 132 years ago to lose the office and win again four years later.While driven into near-exile after the violence of Jan. 6, 2021, Trump quickly began planning a comeback from his home base at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. He announced his 2024 candidacy in November 2022, shortly after congressional elections in which Republican candidates did worse than expected.But the mood of the country was in Trump's favor this year.In poll after poll, Americans for months overwhelmingly said they believed the country was headed in the wrong direction.Harris cast herself as a "new generation of leadership" and the forward-looking candidate who would work across the aisle and seek solutions, not political warfare, to address America's concerns over rising costs and housing affordability.But given Harris’ status as a sitting vice president, she never fit the mold of a traditional “change candidate,” and she remained tethered to President Joe Biden – staying loyal to him even as Americans made clear they disapproved of his handling of inflation and migration at the southern border.Trump’s victory puts the nation on a vastly different course than the one charted over the past four years by Biden, who beat Trump in 2020 in a close race that Trump still claims he won.Trump vowed that if given another term, he would begin the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, seek retribution against his perceived political enemies, send the military into Chicago and other cities coping with violence, and impose tariffs of as much as 10% on most foreign goods.Echoing comments he made on the campaign trail, Trump called his supporters “the greatest political movement of all time” and said his victory and the Republican wins in Congress had provided “an unprecedented and powerful mandate.” He promised to help the country heal after a divisive election season, stressing that “we have to put our county first for at least a period of time.”“We have to fix it,” he said.Contributing: Joey Garrison

CONTENT: Wyoming’s conservative 93-seat state legislature currently boasts 86 Republicans, making it difficult for Democrats to pick up seats. Although the outcome of the Cowboy State's political future was largely decided in the August primary, there are still some opportunities for Democrats to increase their coalition on Election Day.Here's a look at the top three races that could flip for Wyoming Democrats.The former house seat of state representative Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, came into play when he announced his candidacy for the Wyoming State Senate. Former legislator and Democrat Sara Burlingame, director of the state’s best-known LGBTQ-focused nonprofit, Wyoming Equality, will square off against newcomer Jacob Wasserburger, who defeated Seth Ulvestad in Wyoming’s August primary.Burlingame, a prominent figure in Wyoming politics, may have a chance to return to the Capitol as a rare liberal voice but her visibility makes her a target in conservative circles. While Wasserburger hasn't been endorsed by the Freedom Caucus, the group has circulated mailers supporting him.Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Republican incumbent Sarah Penn, a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, will face off against Democrat challenger Ivan Posey, a longtime member of the Eastern Shoshone Business Council. Penn clinched the spot by unseating Northern Arapaho legislator Andi Lebeau in 2022.House District 33 encompasses much of Wyoming’s Wind River Indian Reservation, which is home to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribal nations.With the impending departure of Navajo State Senator Affie Ellis (R-Cheyenne), a loss from Posey, who has both Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho ancestry, would mean no Indigenous representation in the Wyoming legislature.Penn is a member of Wyoming’s growing far-right and holds hardline conservative stances on issues from abortion to DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programming. Posey bills himself as a “conservative Democrat” and emphasizes the importance of having a representative who has a deep understanding of the reservation's communities.Two potential newcomers to the Wyoming State Legislature, Democrat Jen Solis and Republican Gary Brown, will wrestle for control of the district that Spans North-Central Cheyenne. Brown took the Republican crown from incumbent Bill Henderson in the August primary.With the exits of state senator Anthony Bouchard and state representative Jeanette Ward, Brown could be poised to take on the mantle of the legislature's conservative firebrand. He recently compared a politics and government journalist at the right-leaning Cowboy State Daily to Marxist Leon Trotsky.Solis, who has previously run for the seat, aims to appeal to moderate voters in the district. She is concerned about government restrictions on abortion access and has spoken out against book bans in public schools and libraries in Wyoming.Wyoming Election Results 2024:Live updates, maps for every state raceCy Neff reports on Wyoming politics for USA TODAY.

CONTENT: Dolly Parton has long kept mum about her personal politics.Many think they can assume what she believes, due to her long history of supporting gay rights, lifting up women, and her philanthropic efforts — like Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, which gives away free books and helps teach children to read, as well as funding COVID-19 vaccines.However, the "Jolene" singer has refused to reveal how she votes, and even walked back statements supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016, due to people assuming she had given her an endorsement. The country legend prefers to remain mysterious for herself — and for her fans.Here's a look at some of Parton's vaguely political statements over the years.On the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky incident (1990s)Amid the fallout from the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal, Parton refused to condemn the disgraced president. In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, Parton was asked about this stance.She doubled down, explaining, "Yeah! I know those men. In every man I see someone in my family." However, when the writer asked if she saw her brothers in Donald Trump, she responded, "I ain't talking about Trump!"On gay rights (2016)Larry King asked Dolly Parton about being supportive of gay rights during an interview posted to YouTube on Aug 29, 2016. The songstress was quick to note that she has been "made" the poster child for gay rights. However, that doesn't mean she doesn't still stand up for them."They've made me the poster child, I think, only because I'm so outspoken as far as being accepting of people in general," Parton explained. "I do not believe that we should criticize and judge other people. I think we should be accepting and loving. We are all God's children. We are who we are, and we should be allowed to be who we are."King pointed out that her open-minded stance likely made religious groups quite unhappy. She acknowledged how often that happened, but it doesn't deter her."Well, if you're the fine Christian that you think you are, why are you judging people? That's God's job. We're not God," she maintained. "We're not judges. You know, we're supposed to love one another. We're supposed to not judge. And we're not supposed to take vengeance on other people. That's God's job. So I got too much to do on my own to try to do God's work too."On the possibility of a female president (2016)During the 2016 presidential election, Parton was asked in a New York Times interview about a potential female presidency. She responded, "Hillary (Clinton) might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary's very qualified. So if she gets it, I'll certainly be behind her."However, she did follow that statement up with a signature Dolly joke, adding, "I think no matter if it's Hillary or Donald Trump, we're gonna be plagued with PMS either way — presidential mood swings!" After people started writing that she had endorsed Hillary, Parton took to Facebook to release an official statement that walked back her previous remarks."This morning while I was watching the news I saw many reports that I had endorsed Hillary Clinton. My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race. But seriously, I have not decided who I'm voting for," the statement read.On Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda's bold statement at the Emmy's (2017)'9 to 5' stars @LilyTomlin and @Janefonda take a shot at Trump while presenting at the #Emmys https://t.co/uoBJ9WSQFC pic.twitter.com/7t36A0SAdlParton joined her 9 to 5 co-stars Tomlin and Fonda onstage during the 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards. Fonda and Tomlin took that moment to condemn then-President Trump in the name of their feminist film."Back in 1980, when we made that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot ..." Fonda began. "... And it's true in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot," Tomlin finished.Parton, meanwhile, looked visibly uncomfortable and made big surprised eyes as they spoke — while she kept her mouth shut, before making a joke about her breasts to change the subject.In 2019, Parton was asked about her clear discomfort, and she explained that she doesn't "like to be known by the company I keep, so to speak." She continued, "I want to be my own individual self. If I've got something to say, I'll say it, but I don't want to be dragged into it."When pressed, Parton added, "Well, it was not a surprise, knowing Lily and Jane. I just did not want everybody to think that whatever they think is what I think. I don't really like getting up on TV and saying political things. I don't even want to make a deal out of it, but I want people to know I'm my own individual self.""Even though [Fonda, Tomlin, and I] may agree on a whole lot of things – and they may have more agreement [between] themselves because they've been together for longer – I still have my own thoughts and my own way of doing things. It's not a matter of being disrespectful, it's just, OK, that's what they said, I'm not getting involved in it," she said.On whether she considers herself a feminist (2019)In an interview with The Guardian published on February 24, 2019, Parton was asked if she considers herself a feminist."I mean, I must be if being a feminist means I'm all for women, yes," she said. "But I don't feel I have to march, hold up a sign or label myself. I think the way I have conducted my life and my business and myself speaks for itself. I don't think of it as being feminist. It's not a label I have to put on myself. I'm just all for gals."On keeping the peace (2019)During a 2019 episode of Dolly Parton's America Podcast, she shared, "I don't do politics. I have too many fans on both sides of the fence. Of course, I have my opinion, but I learned years ago to keep my mouth shut about things."Parton maintained this sentiment during a 2019 interview with The Guardian, explaining, "I've got as many Republican friends as I've got Democrat friends, and I just don't like voicing my opinion on things."She also referred to the controversy surrounding the Chicks (then known as The Dixie Chicks) speaking up against the Iraq invasion in 2003. "I've seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks. You can ruin a career for speaking out." Parton continued, "I respect my audience too much for that, I respect myself too much for that. Of course I have my own opinions, but that don't mean I got to throw them out there, because you're going to piss off half the people."On keeping mum for her own sanity (2019)Parton also explained that her decision not to talk politics also has to do with her own sanity. "It's not like there's some big mystery, I just know you can't just ... I'm just private, put it that way," she said."Even though I'm public, there's still a very private side. But that's what keeps me sane, and I guess it's what keeps people intrigued – they think they're going to find out something more. But you're only going to know as much as I'm going to tell you," Parton added.On not accepting the President Medal of Freedom AwardIn 2021, the country singer revealed to NBC's Today that she had turned down two offers of the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award — the highest civilian honor in the US — from then-President Trump. However, she said that rather than having to do with politics, it was actually because of illness."I got offered the Freedom Award from the Trump administration. I couldn't accept it because my husband was ill. Then they asked me again about it, and I wouldn't travel because of Covid."She did note, however, that if she accepted the award from President Biden — who she said had already made the offer — then she would have to think it over due to the possible political implications."Now I feel like if I take it, it'll be doing politics, so I'm not so sure," Parton said.

CONTENT: Millennials are moving to new cities and states based on politics, a new report from Realtor.com found.While national and local politics can impact anyone's choice of place to live, millennials seem to have a stronger political inclination to pack up their bags than other generations.Roughly 33 percent of millennials said their decisions about where to live are highly influenced by national politics, while just 25 percent of Gen Z, 21 percent of Gen X and 16 percent of baby boomers said the same.More From Newsweek Vault: New NAR Report Highlights the Challenges Homebuyers Face, Especially Young AdultsThe survey looked at responses from more than 2,200 adults in September.And one-third of millennials said it was very or extremely important to live in a place where most people share their political views, while the rest of the generations hovered in the 16 percent to 23 percent range.More From Newsweek Vault: How to Calculate How Much House You Can AffordAltogether, 28 percent of millennials said they considered moving because their political views didn't align with most of the people where they lived."It seems that more people these days are less tolerant of other opinions, thoughts and political beliefs than in the past," nationwide title and escrow expert Alan Chang told Newsweek. "This is how the media portrays society and the separation has pushed many to avoid conflict and seek like-minded neighbors."Compared to the general population, only one in five adults considered moving over political differences, but this could become more intensified in the aftermath of the 2024 election, when many states appeared to become more conservative than in past elections.More From Newsweek Vault: Should I Buy a House Now or Wait? How to Determine the Right Time to Get a Mortgage"Choosing where to live is often a complex decision, and for many Americans, especially millennials, local and national politics are factors that influence where they live," Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, said in a statement."With both local and national politicians making decisions that impact daily life, both socially and fiscally, it makes sense that many would prefer to live in areas where the politics align with their own beliefs. Some go so far as to consider moving to find that alignment."Only 38 percent of Americans felt that their political views were aligned with the majority of people where they live, but millennials could be more likely to prioritize political leanings as a result of their stage of life."While Gen Z is known for being very politically active, when it comes to making decisions about where to live, more millennials are likely to be in a phase of life where they are thinking about the type of community in which they want to buy a home and grow their roots," Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, said in a statement."It makes sense that millennials, more than any other age group, think it is very important to live in a place in which most people share their political views."Across the board, those who identified as liberal were more likely to prioritize politics when deciding where to live. Roughly 30 percent of liberals said national politics influenced where they lived, compared to 18 percent of moderates and 27 percent of conservatives."In the past, neighbors could disagree and still be cordial and even friendly, but the common media portrayal is division and conflict," Chang said.Millennials often feel that politics more intensely impacts their lives than younger or older generations, said Ralph McLaughlin, a senior economist at Realtor.com."Millennials are perhaps more inclined to live near others with similar political beliefs because they are at an age where they feel political decisions affect more aspects of their lives when compared to either younger generations, who are still maturing both financially and individually, or older generations, who are past their peak earning and familial years," McLaughlin told Newsweek."For them, being in a politically friendly environment possibly gives millennials more assurance than other generations that local and state political decisions will best suit their preferences."Suzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

CONTENT: All Americans are hoping for a happy, healthy, and harmonious Thanksgiving. So if you're a guest at someone else's home for the big day, you've got to be on your best behavior—lest you upset your generous hosts.Newsweek asked some of America's top etiquette experts: What is the biggest faux pas a Thanksgiving guest can commit? This is what they told us.As a guest, the biggest Thanksgiving faux pas is steering the conversation toward politics. Thanksgiving is about family, gratitude, and joy—a time to celebrate connection, not controversy.Instead, have meaningful and upbeat discussions: Ask about recent travels, books, new jobs, or exciting plans.Create curiosity and share laughter. Save polarizing topics for another day and focus on what truly matters—cherished moments and lively, positive conversation around the table.The biggest Thanksgiving faux pas is bringing uninvited guests to the dinner. A gracious host may not turn them away, doing so is both disrespectful and inconsiderate.The host has carefully planned and prepared for a specific number of guests, and unexpected additions can disrupt their efforts.Always seek permission well in advance if you'd like to include someone, it's a simple act of courtesy that honors the host's planning and hospitality.Being negative instead of being a festive part of the day.Saying rude things: "You ballooned up since last year, you might want to back away from the buffet! Did you change your hair color? What exactly do you call that shade?"Bringing up old grievances, when it's better to leave those bones buried with the turkey carcass.Don't arrive empty-handed, but that doesn't mean you can bring your 60-pound St. Bernard unannounced, even though we all probably do need an emotional support animal when spending time with extended family.Being over zealous with your spritzing and showing up smelling like the entire perfume/ cologne counter from Macy's. Causing your family and friends' eyes and noses to sting and burn.Of course bringing up politics, when the host has asked for the day to be a no-politics zone.Acting crazy if your football team is trailing. I'm quite sure that player/team isn't contributing to your 401k, it's just a game so pipe down and enjoy the game.Announcing you are a vegetarian, fruitarian, allergic to gluten etc., your new diet etc. It's the one day of the year that all diets, or talk of diets, is off limits. If you are a vegetarian or fruitarian, bring something to share with everyone, a veggie lasagne etc.Come with upbeat fun topical things to talk about other than your little Johnny being gifted. Things like your travels, new hobbies, new and upcoming adventures, work etc.Rudeness at the table, especially through poor conversation skills, is the biggest faux pas for everyone involved.Interrupting others, monopolizing the conversation, or steering discussions toward controversial or inappropriate topics—such as politics, religion, or personal critiques—can quickly sour the atmosphere.Complaining about the food, comparing it to other meals, or ignoring efforts made by the host also comes across as disrespectful and unappreciative.A Thanksgiving table is a space for gratitude and connection, so practicing active listening, showing genuine interest in others, and keeping the conversation light and inclusive are essential to being a gracious guest. Keep your mindset positive!You can show additional appreciation by helping the host clear the table, offering to help with dishes, and not rushing to leave as soon as dinner is over.Think about the Griswald's Christmas Vacation movie when Uncle Eddie's wife overcooks the turkey...and Clark, along with all the other family members, eats it without complaining as the dried turkey skin gets stuck in their throat.Of all the holidays we mark annually, for many Americans, Thanksgiving seems to have acquired an unfortunate sense of dread.Family members worry about locking horns with their political opposites or facing uncomfortable questions such as "Don't you two ever plan on getting married?" or "Have you put on weight?"For some, the solution is to retire to the den and turn on a football game. For others, it may be to skip the gathering altogether.If we are to embrace the true spirit of the celebration, it's not about intrusive questions. It's about coming together over a meal and giving thanks for our many blessings.I believe that if more family members and friends looked at Thanksgiving as an opportunity to reconnect with relatives near and distant and to be the best version of ourselves while doing so, we would have far better odds at bringing out the best in others, too.And in so doing, we would have an occasion for which everyone could truly and authentically feel grateful.1. Drinking too much: If alcohol is served, and even if you bring your own, don't overindulge and make a fool of yourself. Remember the old adage: "Loose lips sink ships."2. Arriving empty-handed: It's considered good etiquette to bring something for the host, whether it's a dish, dessert, or even a bottle of wine. (But don't expect the host to open your wine. It's considered a gift.) Always ask: "May I bring something?"3. Not offering to help: After the meal, it's polite to offer assistance with cleaning up or serving. Your willingness to help is seen as a sign of appreciation for the host's hard work.4. Discussing controversial topics: Tensions can run high during Thanksgiving dinners, especially when family is involved. Bringing up sensitive subjects like politics (especially during an election season), the cost of things, or religion can lead to uncomfortable conversations. Be prepared to talk about light-hearted subjects like holiday memories, food, and travel.5. Being late: Arriving late can disrupt the flow of the gathering and may cause the host unnecessary stress. It's courteous to arrive on time, or at least to communicate if you're running late. And NEVER surprise the host by bringing an uninvited guest without first asking permission.The biggest faux pas you can commit as a Thanksgiving guest is making everything about you—basically becoming the dreaded "Thanksgiving Narcissist."This is the tiresome guest who texts the host a paragraph of dietary preferences then acts upset when there isn't a special gluten-free, sugar-free version of every dish.They press the host for the guest list to determine the event's social value before committing to attend.When told it's a formal gathering, they begrudgingly consent while trying to convince you that everyone would really rather come in their Uggs and comfy sweatpants.By the time they finish expressing their demands, the host is already regretting the invitation!The role of a guest at Thanksgiving (or frankly anytime) is to contribute to the warmth of the gathering, not drain it.A gracious guest arrives grateful for the invitation, bringing their best self: sharing entertaining stories, laughing easily, engaging in thoughtful conversations, and helping to create lasting memories. This will guarantee an invitation back every time!Our responsibility as guests starts from the moment we receive an invitation.The general etiquette missteps while attending an event are not RSVP, not being punctual, not bringing a gift, not making a good impression, inappropriate dress code, not knowing when to leave, not sending a thank you card. Just to list a few.However, for this year's Thanksgiving dinner, the biggest faux pas in my opinion will be...discussing politics or our poor communication skills! We all know certain topics might be taboo such as religion, sex, personal matters, money and...of course politics.We should always read the room and understand what kind of topics we can start and entertain. This might sound like common sense but unfortunately, it is not always a common practice.If the guests are not too passionate about political topics this might be a good way for all opinions to blend into one intelligent conversation and we all can learn from each other. We can focus on common ground instead of our differences.Of course, in some situations, we might not be able to come to an agreement and this is the moment when we can excuse ourselves and focus on something or somebody else.Showing gratitude to the host is paramount and participating in the gathering by bringing a positive energy will be greatly appreciated. Or otherwise, our Thanksgiving turkey might be at stake and our relationships and guest reputation, too.Coming empty-handed and not offering to bring something or contribute if you are being hosted would be the biggest Thanksgiving faux pas, as the holiday is about thankfulness, togetherness and community.Shane Croucher is a Senior Editor based in London, UK.

CONTENT: Few people in America have done more to advance conservative causes than Leonard LeoNORTHEAST HARBOR, Maine -- When Donald Trump was elected president earlier this month, Caroline Pryor’s mind turned immediately to the man who lives down the road — Leonard Leo.Few people in America have done more to advance conservative causes than Leo. Years ago, the then-unknown conservative lawyer began executing a plan that has helped reshape the U.S. courts and Republican politics, an effort that culminated in Trump’s first term with the appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices.The success moved Leo out of the shadows, turning him into a hero to conservatives and a villain to liberals. But for his neighbors on a sparsely populated island off the coast of Maine, the equation is more complicated. Leo and his family moved to Mount Desert Island in 2020, seeking a relatively anonymous life among its unpretentious year-round residents. A refuge it has not turned out to be.The conservative’s presence — despite significant charitable giving to local nonprofits and big spending locally — has generated fissures in a place known for tranquility. That anxiety has only spiked since Trump’s victory.“It feels very personal,” said Pryor, a 65-year-old who has lived on the island for four decades. “He comes to a small quiet community in the very northeast corner of the country and does this evil, far-reaching work that is going to affect so many millions of people, but he wants to just live this anonymous, quiet life.”Those feelings were on display on a brisk morning in October, just two weeks before November’s election. With sunlight flickering through the yellowing leaves, Pryor and a dozen other people — mostly women — gathered outside Leo’s estate to protest during the island’s annual marathon.They came armed with a cartoonish life-sized puppet of Leo, a rainbow arch for runners to pass through and blue and pink chalk with which they scribbled slogans — “You Are Amazing, Leonard Leo Is Not” — across the road. They rang cowbells as a boombox blasted Dolly Parton, Taylor Swift and Queen.“We are making people on the island aware of who he is, and they might question taking his money,” Mary Jane Schepers, one of the protesters, said as she urged runners to flip off Leo’s home. “They are taking dirty money."Leo, in response to a series of written questions, said he “had never really thought about” whether his move to the island would spur opposition.“While I disagree with them and with what some of them do and say, they are people created by God with dignity and worth and their presence has been an invitation to pray for them,” Leo wrote. He declined an interview request.Leo, 59, and his family for decades have vacationed on Mount Desert Island, an idyllic island known for its rocky beauty, windswept beaches and the famed Acadia National Park.In 2018, he purchased a $3.3 million, 8,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate in Northeast Harbor, one of Mount Desert Island’s wealthiest towns. Some of the country’s most influential and wealthy people — scions like John D. Rockefeller Jr., billionaires like Mitchell Rales and celebrities such as Martha Stewart — have sought privacy and anonymity on the island. Backlash swiftly followed Leo's arrival. The next year, protesters descended on his home as he hosted a fundraiser for Republican Sen. Susan Collins. He soon drew more protests when he was invited to introduce the then-president of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, at a nearby college, leading the institution to rescind the invitation.The protests grew near the end of Trump’s first term and spiked after the conservative-dominated Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.The activist’s initial goal was lofty: Convince Leo to leave. When that failed, they turned their focus to informing residents about the man in the Tudor-style mansion.“He felt he could come here, and it would be a place to get away” from the negative attention he gets for his politics, said Murray Ngoima, a regular protester. “We have managed to draw attention to what he is doing. And that is a problem for him.”The protests have compelled Leo to step up security at his estate. A protester was arrested in 2022, a confrontation with police that led to a lawsuit and $62,500 settlement over First Amendment violations.Amid the protests, Leo has stepped up his charitable giving, telling The Associated Press that the activists have "strengthened our conviction to be as active as possible in helping various institutions on the island.” That has meant tens of thousands of dollars to local nonprofits.He and his wife, Sally, gave over $50,000 in 2020 to the Island Housing Trust, an organization seeking to boost the amount of affordable housing on the island, according to the trust’s annual giving report that also listed Leo as a member of the group's leadership committee. They made similar donations over the next three years, trustrecordsshow, consistently ranking them among the group's top donors. Leo and his wife were also listed as donors to the Mount Desert Island Hospital. The Leos have also been listed as regulardonorsto theNortheast Harbor Library.Those donations have raised suspicion, with protesters urging the groups to return the money and comparing the donations to the way Leo has used the money to influence Republican politics.“He is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Susan Covino Buell, an island resident. “We can’t just act like he is a regular person in our community.”Buell, 75, resigned her position on the housing nonprofit's campaign committee when Leo got involved with the charity. She had tried to convince the nonprofit to reject the money “because I just felt it was so tainted,” Buell said.The trust’s executive director did not respond to the AP’s request for comment.A group of anti-Leo activists also penned an open letter urging the hospital to return the donation because of Leo’s role in ending federal abortion protections.Mariah Cormier, a hospital spokesperson, said the institution accepts “charitable donations that aid in strengthening the health and vibrancy of our community."Leo dismissed the idea his donations were aimed at buying acceptance from a skeptical community, saying people “can judge for themselves why I do what I do.”It isn’t just Leo’s philanthropy that is controversial. His business at local establishments presents a quandary for shop owners and service workers. Many said they oppose Leo’s political positions, but they need his money to sustain their enterprises, allowing shops and restaurants that once closed during frigid winters to stay open longer.Leo is such a sensitive topic that multiple shop owners declined to be interviewed about the wealthy conservative lawyer, explaining they did not want to damage their relationship with him by discussing how his views conflicted with their own and the internal conflict his business causes.Leo, a devout Roman Catholic, has also used money to influence the island’s Catholic churches.Sacred Spaces Foundation, a nonprofit that counts Leo as its president and sole member, purchased St. Ignatius of Loyola Catholic Church in Northeast Harbor for $2.65 million in 2023 from the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, according to records obtained from the county government. The church now holds one service a week during the summer, when Northeast Harbor is busiest.Leo is a regular at another parish, Holy Redeemer, a large stone sanctuary in Bar Harbor where his wife is the head of the music ministry. His presence has driven off some longtime congregants, residents said.Lindy Stretch, an 80-year-old who converted to Catholicism at Holy Redeemer over a decade ago, left the congregation because of what she said was Leo’s growing influence in the church. “I just couldn’t stand to watch that,” Stretch said.Asked about people leaving the island church, Leo wrote he was “thankful for every person who takes the time to come to Holy Redeemer and is striving to be in union with the church and Christ, regardless of what they do or believe in their private lives.”Not everyone is upset about Leo’s Maine move. Though the island's population is liberal — over 70% of residents voted against Trump in 2024 — Republicans in the state have come to Leo’s defense.House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, who represents a district just off the island, excoriated the protesters in an op-ed and heralded Leo in an interview for “sticking to his beliefs and donating to the causes he believes in.”Since 2020, Leo’s network has funneled over $1 million to conservative causes in the state, including around $800,000 to a policy institute that funds a conservative website and over $300,000 to a conservative state representative’s political network.Those donations have only deepened the opposition to Leo among his most frequent protesters, they said.Most who gathered in October to protest during the marathon have lost count of how often they have met outside Leo’s estate. They have come so frequently they have a routine — each standing in the same place, chanting the same slogans and waving the same signs.Though energized, they have come to accept they may never drive Leo from the island.“He is succeeding,” admitted Bo Greene, a 63-year-old who lives in Bar Harbor, citing the way nonprofits have taken his money. “We are making him uncomfortable, and he hates us,” she said. “But he is still here.”After the last marathoner had plodded by, the women collected their trash and packed away their puppet and signs before heading home.A few hours later, it was like they had never even been there.Not even their chalk slogans on the road remained: Someone had washed them away.___AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

CONTENT: Those left adrift by Trump’s rise must now engage in a new project.Those of us who first became politically homeless in 2016 have lately been in a quandary: We need to figure out who we are. If we are not to succumb to the Saruman trap—going along with populist authoritarians in the foolish hope of using them for higher purposes—then we had better establish what we stand for.Labels matter in politics. They can also lose their meaning. There is, for example, nothing “conservative” about the MAGA movement, which is, in large part, reactionary, looking for a return to an idealized past, when it is not merely a cult of personality. Today’s progressives are a long, long way from their predecessors of the early 20th century—just invoke Theodore Roosevelt’s name at a gathering of “the Squad” and see what happens.Even the terms left and right—derived, let us remember, from seating arrangements in the National Assembly during the early days of the French Revolution—no longer convey much. Attitudes toward government coercion of various kinds, deficit spending, the rule of law—neither party holds consistent views on these subjects. The activist bases of both Democrats and Republicans like the idea of expanding executive power at the expense of Congress and the courts. Both see American foreign policy in past decades as a tale of unremitting folly, best resolved by leaving the world to its own devices. Both brood over fears and resentments, and shun those who do not share their deepest prejudices.David Frum: A good country’s bad choiceWhat is worse is the extent to which the MAGA- and progressive-activist worlds are more interested in destroying institutions than building them. Both denounce necessary parts of government (the Department of Justice on the one hand, police departments on the other); seek to enforce speech codes; threaten to drive those they consider their enemies from public life; and pursue justice (as they understand it) in a spirit of reckless self-righteousness using prosecution as a form of retribution. Neither group of wreckers, for example, would really like to see, let alone help rebuild, the great universities as politically neutral oases of education rather than incubators of their own partisans.To call those made politically homeless by the rise of Donald Trump “conservatives” no longer makes sense. To be a conservative is to want to slow down or stop change and preserve institutions and practices as they are, or to enable them to evolve slowly. But in recent decades, so much damage has been inflicted on norms of public speech and conduct that it is not enough to slow the progress of political decay. To the extent that the plain meaning of the word conservatism is indeed a commitment to preservation, that battle has been lost, and on multiple fronts.We certainly are not “progressives” either. We do not believe that progress is inevitable (and can be accelerated), or that history bends in a certain direction. Being on the right side of history is a phrase that sends chills down the spines of those of us who have a somewhat dark view of human nature. The notion that the arc of history bends inexorably toward justice died for many of us in the middle of the 20th century. Moreover, the modern progressive temper, with its insistence on orthodoxies on such specifics as pronouns and a rigid and all-encompassing categorization of oppressors and victims, is intolerable for many of us.What we are is a kind of old-fashioned liberal—a point recently made by the former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky. Liberal is not an entirely satisfactory term, but given the impoverishment of today’s political vocabulary, it will have to do.What does being a liberal mean, particularly in a second Trump term, when politics has become coarse and brutal and the partisan divide seems uncrossable?It begins with a commitment to the notion of “freedom”—that is, a freedom that most suits human nature at its finest and requires not only the legal protection to express itself but a set of internal restraints based on qualities now in short supply: prudent good judgment, the ability to empathize, the desire to avoid unnecessary hurt, a large measure of tolerance for disagreement, an awareness that error awaits all of us. We agree with Alexis de Tocqueville, who argued in Democracy in America, that it is mœurs—mores or habits of belief or norms—and not laws alone that keep America free.If this does not sound like a partisan political agenda, that is because it is not. It is, rather, a temperament, a set of dispositions rooted in beliefs about the challenges and promise of free self-government. It is an assertion of the primacy of those deeper values over the urgency of any specific political program, and reflects a belief that, ultimately, they matter more.Cardinal John Henry Newman, whose early-19th-century writings shaped the idea of a liberal education, famously captured these qualities in his description of the product of such an education:He is never mean or little in his disputes, never takes unfair advantage, never mistakes personalities or sharp sayings for arguments, or insinuates evil which he dare not say out loud. He has too much good sense to be affronted at insults, he is too well employed to remember injury … He is patient, forbearing, and resigned, on philosophical principles; he submits to pain because it is inevitable, to bereavement, because it is irreparable, and to death, because it is his destiny. He may be right or wrong in his opinion, but he is too clear-headed to be unjust … He knows the weakness of human reason as well as its strength, its province and its limits.These qualities will, no doubt, seem otherworldly to many. They are not the stuff of which a vigorous political party will be built; they are easily mocked and impossible to tweet. They are more the stuff of statesmanship than politics. They will satisfy neither of our political parties, and certainly none of their bigoted partisans. They will not, at least in the short run, capture the imagination of the American people. They are probably not the winning creed of a political movement that can capture the presidency in 2028, or secure majorities in the House or Senate.Caitlin Flanagan: The Democrats’ billionaire mistakeBut principled liberals of the modern American type can exercise influence if they are patient, willing to argue, and, above all, if they do not give up. We can write and speak, attempt to persuade, and engage. Our influence, to the extent that we have it, will be felt in the long term and indirectly. It may be felt most, and is most urgently needed, in the field of education, beginning in the early years when young people acquire the instincts and historical knowledge that can make them thoughtful citizens. It is a long-term project, but that is nothing new: The struggle to eliminate formal discrimination on the basis of race and religion in public life took a very long time as well.True liberals are short-term pessimists, because they understand the dark side of human nature, but long-run optimists about human potential, which is why they believe in freedom. At this troubled moment, we should neither run from the public square nor chant jeremiads while shaking our fists at the heavens. We need to be the anti-hysterics, the unflappable skeptics, the persistent advocates for the best of the old values and practices in new conditions. We need to persistently make our case.Nor is this a matter of argument only. We need to be the ones who not only articulate but embody certain standards of behavior and thought. We may need the courage that the first editor of this magazine described as the willingness to “dare to be, in the right with two or three.” For sure, we should follow the motto that he coined for The Atlantic and be “of no party or clique.” If that means journeying in a political wilderness for a while, well, there are precedents for that. Besides, those who travel with us will be good company—and may be considerably more numerous than we now think.More StoriesIsrael Is Fighting a Different War NowBrace for the Storm

CONTENT: President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, less than two weeks before his sentencing was, in my view, the right thing to do. It was an act of compassion and a practical solution to a legal case that had become hopelessly entangled in partisan politics.But while the pardon itself may have been justified, the president's repeated and unequivocal denials that he would ever consider such a move were deeply damaging. It was obvious to anyone following the situation closely that he would eventually issue the pardon. By refusing to admit the possibility beforehand, Biden contributed to the pervasive erosion of trust in politics and politicians.Let's first address why the pardon was the right decision. Hunter Biden's legal troubles, while serious, were not particularly extraordinary in the grand scheme of federal prosecutions. He faced charges of failing to pay taxes on time and illegally owning a firearm while struggling with addiction. While these offenses are not trivial, they hardly make him the criminal mastermind Republicans have portrayed him to be.What set Hunter's case apart was not the nature of his crimes but the context in which they unfolded. The president's son has long been a lightning rod for partisan attacks, used as a stand-in for every baseless accusation of corruption or impropriety hurled at Joe Biden. Under such circumstances, it understandable why so many loud voices argued that the Hunter Biden proceedings were less about his actions and more about the political theater surrounding them.There is also a historical and moral precedent for such an act of clemency. Presidents have often used pardons to temper justice with mercy, even in politically fraught circumstances. Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, though controversial at the time, is now widely seen as a necessary step to help the country move past the Watergate scandal. More recently, Barack Obama commuted the sentences of nonviolent drug offenders to rectify systemic injustices in the criminal justice system. In this context, Biden's pardon of his son can be viewed as a similarly humane and pragmatic decision.But the decision to pardon Hunter was not purely altruistic; it was also politically astute. One of the less-discussed dynamics of this situation is the omnipresent specter of the next president—Donald Trump.It is not hard to imagine a scenario in which Trump, returning to the presidency, could have seized on the case to embarrass the Biden family further. Imagine how much worse it would have looked if Trump had pardoned Hunter himself—gleefully painting Joe Biden as too weak or too politically impotent to protect his own son. Such a spectacle would have been far more damaging to the presidency than Biden's decision to issue the pardon himself. In some ways, Biden acted preemptively, not just to spare his son but also to avoid handing Trump yet another political cudgel.And yet, Biden's handling of the matter was far from perfect. For months, the president publicly and unequivocally insisted that he would never pardon his son. "Hunter will be treated like any other citizen," he said repeatedly, as if this declaration alone could insulate him from criticism.As I wrote before, these denials were, at best, implausible. From the moment charges were brought against Hunter, it was clear that his case presented a unique challenge to the president—one that would force him to weigh his responsibilities as a father against his duties as commander-in-chief. That Biden would ultimately choose to pardon his son should not have surprised anyone paying attention.But why didn't he say so?This pattern of denial is emblematic of a larger problem in American politics: the pervasive belief among politicians that they cannot afford to be honest with the public. Biden's repeated denials did not shield him from criticism; they only made his eventual decision appear calculated and cynical. Had he been upfront—acknowledging the extraordinary circumstances of his son's case and the difficult choices it posed—he might have turned the pardon into a moment of candor and humanity. Instead, his denials gave the impression of a leader trying to have it both ways: insisting on impartiality while preparing to act out of loyalty.This kind of dishonesty is not unique to Biden, of course. Politicians across the ideological spectrum seem to operate on the assumption that the public cannot handle the truth. They spin, evade, and obfuscate, convinced that transparency will only make them more vulnerable.But in doing so, they have profoundly deepened the public's cynicism and eroded trust in the institutions they are supposed to uphold. Americans are not naive. They can see through the spin, and they are tired of being treated like gullible bystanders in a political drama where the outcomes are all but predetermined.Biden's handling of Hunter's case underscores the steep cost of this dishonesty. When leaders consistently deny what is plainly true—whether it's about pardoning a family member or addressing larger issues like climate change or economic inequality—they reinforce the perception that politics is little more than a game of manipulation.This disillusionment has far-reaching consequences. It drives voters toward populists and demagogues who promise to "tell it like it is," even when their words are laced with lies. It fosters apathy, leaving many citizens disengaged and disenchanted. And it undermines democracy itself, which depends on a basic level of trust between leaders and the people they serve.What the country needs now, more than ever, is leaders who are willing to level with the public—even when the truth is complicated or politically inconvenient. Americans don't expect their politicians to be perfect, but they should be able to expect them to be honest. By failing to meet that standard, Biden missed a chance to build trust at a time when trust is in desperately short supply. His pardon of Hunter was an act of mercy, but his handling of it was a reminder of just how far our politics still has to go.About Aron SolomonA Pulitzer Prize-nominated writer, Aron Solomon, JD, is the chief strategy officer forAmplify.

This beautiful coming-of-age story is an emotional read. Its episodic nature really lets you grow with Sam, weaving in anecdotes that hit home the importance of family, friends, values and, for some, faith.

Demon Copperhead is one of those books I think about at least once a week. A modern take on a Charles Dickens classic, Kingsolver tells a gripping story of a boy from the mountains of Appalachia and the opioid epidemic that has devastated the rural South. She gets the voice right, the people right and the compassion right. This will pull at your heartstrings but never leave you without hope.

By Oisín McKenna | Mariner Books
An immensely readable tale linking the lives of several Londoners in the hot summer of 2019, this impressive debut tackles modern relationships, the mental drain of late-stage capitalism and the timeless attraction to the excitement of life in the big city. It sits somewhere between the works of Zadie Smith and Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City series.

Libby Lost and Found
By Stephanie Booth | Sourcebooks Landmark
I was rooting for the protagonist at every turn. At 40, Libby Weeks is a famous author—though unrecognizable since she writes under a pseudonym. She's overdue to turn in her manuscript for the last book in her fantasy series, but she's been unable to write her beloved characters out of desperate situations. Why? She's got early-onset Alzheimer's and is slowly losing the thread...of her characters and of her life. So she sets out to meet a superfan who has offered to help finish the series. It's a sympathetic and poignant look at what it feels like to have dementia, woven in with a superb fantasy plot. I desperately want to read the Falling Children books Libby authors. Maybe Booth will take it upon herself to write that next!

The Master and Margarita
By Mikhail Bulgakov | Abrams
This long-censored satirization of the Soviet Union not only stands out for being a cunning political critique, but Bulgakov's musical writing makes it an exciting read. That description doesn't do justice for a work of magical realism in which the Devil travels to Moscow with a talking cat named Behemoth, who loves chess and vodka.

Wicked is trendy right now because of the movie, but that's not why I picked this book. I fell in love with Wicked at least a decade ago and haven't stopped loving it since. It's a story about learning to accept what makes us different, finding strength in yourself and not being afraid to journey out on your own.

Simply put, this book will bring out every emotion you can ever feel, particularly anger at an unlikable main character. Typically, it's tough to enjoy a book with a main character like this one, but the way it's written, the fact that it's about a writer trying to make it in the world in the worst way possible and death early on in the book make this worth the read in every way. I don't give five-star ratings easily, and Yellowface took one.

The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium
By Martin Gurri | Stripe Press
I read this book during the presidential campaign after it was recommended to me by a friend. Gurri is an ex-CIA analyst who first published Revolt of the Public in 2014—one year before Donald Trump entered the political scene—and then updated it in 2018. It is incredible how prescient the book was. Its basic thesis is that the proliferation of information through digital media has empowered the public to challenge and undermine the authority of elites, leading to widespread skepticism and a decline in institutional credibility. Gurri effectively predicts the state of both our politics and our media today.

CONTENT: FILE - An image of former President James Madison is seen behind Leonard Leo, as he speaks at the National Lawyers Convention in Washington, in this Nov. 16, 2017 file photo. (AP Photo/Sait Serkan Gurbuz, file)NORTHEAST HARBOR, Maine (AP) — When Donald Trump was elected president earlier this month, Caroline Pryor’s mind turned immediately to the man who lives down the road — Leonard Leo.Few people in America have done more to advance conservative causes than Leo. Years ago, the then-unknown conservative lawyer began executing a plan that has helped reshape the U.S. courts and Republican politics, an effort that culminated in Trump’s first term with the appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices.The success moved Leo out of the shadows, turning him into a hero to conservatives and a villain to liberals. But for his neighbors on a sparsely populated island off the coast of Maine, the equation is more complicated. Leo and his family moved to Mount Desert Island in 2020, seeking a relatively anonymous life among its unpretentious year-round residents. A refuge it has not turned out to be.The conservative’s presence — despite significant charitable giving to local nonprofits and big spending locally — has generated fissures in a place known for tranquility. That anxiety has only spiked since Trump’s victory.“It feels very personal,” said Pryor, a 65-year-old who has lived on the island for four decades. “He comes to a small quiet community in the very northeast corner of the country and does this evil, far-reaching work that is going to affect so many millions of people, but he wants to just live this anonymous, quiet life.”Those feelings were on display on a brisk morning in October, just two weeks before November’s election. With sunlight flickering through the yellowing leaves, Pryor and a dozen other people — mostly women — gathered outside Leo’s estate to protest during the island’s annual marathon.They came armed with a cartoonish life-sized puppet of Leo, a rainbow arch for runners to pass through and blue and pink chalk with which they scribbled slogans — “You Are Amazing, Leonard Leo Is Not” — across the road. They rang cowbells as a boombox blasted Dolly Parton, Taylor Swift and Queen.“We are making people on the island aware of who he is, and they might question taking his money,” Mary Jane Schepers, one of the protesters, said as she urged runners to flip off Leo’s home. “They are taking dirty money.”Leo, in response to a series of written questions, said he “had never really thought about” whether his move to the island would spur opposition.“While I disagree with them and with what some of them do and say, they are people created by God with dignity and worth and their presence has been an invitation to pray for them,” Leo wrote. He declined an interview request.Leo, 59, and his family for decades have vacationed on Mount Desert Island, an idyllic island known for its rocky beauty, windswept beaches and the famed Acadia National Park.In 2018, he purchased a $3.3 million, 8,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate in Northeast Harbor, one of Mount Desert Island’s wealthiest towns. Some of the country’s most influential and wealthy people — scions like John D. Rockefeller Jr., billionaires like Mitchell Rales and celebrities such as Martha Stewart — have sought privacy and anonymity on the island. Backlash swiftly followed Leo’s arrival. The next year, protesters descended on his home as he hosted a fundraiser for Republican Sen. Susan Collins. He soon drew more protests when he was invited to introduce the then-president of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, at a nearby college, leading the institution to rescind the invitation.The protests grew near the end of Trump’s first term and spiked after the conservative-dominated Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.The activist’s initial goal was lofty: Convince Leo to leave. When that failed, they turned their focus to informing residents about the man in the Tudor-style mansion.“He felt he could come here, and it would be a place to get away” from the negative attention he gets for his politics, said Murray Ngoima, a regular protester. “We have managed to draw attention to what he is doing. And that is a problem for him.”The protests have compelled Leo to step up security at his estate. A protester was arrested in 2022, a confrontation with police that led to a lawsuit and $62,500 settlement over First Amendment violations.Amid the protests, Leo has stepped up his charitable giving, telling The Associated Press that the activists have “strengthened our conviction to be as active as possible in helping various institutions on the island.” That has meant tens of thousands of dollars to local nonprofits.He and his wife, Sally, gave over $50,000 in 2020 to the Island Housing Trust, an organization seeking to boost the amount of affordable housing on the island, according to the trust’s annual giving report that also listed Leo as a member of the group’s leadership committee. They made similar donations over the next three years, trustrecordsshow, consistently ranking them among the group’s top donors. Leo and his wife were also listed as donors to the Mount Desert Island Hospital. The Leos have also been listed as regulardonorsto theNortheast Harbor Library.Those donations have raised suspicion, with protesters urging the groups to return the money and comparing the donations to the way Leo has used the money to influence Republican politics.“He is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Susan Covino Buell, an island resident. “We can’t just act like he is a regular person in our community.”Buell, 75, resigned her position on the housing nonprofit’s campaign committee when Leo got involved with the charity. She had tried to convince the nonprofit to reject the money “because I just felt it was so tainted,” Buell said.The trust’s executive director did not respond to the AP’s request for comment.A group of anti-Leo activists also penned an open letter urging the hospital to return the donation because of Leo’s role in ending federal abortion protections.Mariah Cormier, a hospital spokesperson, said the institution accepts “charitable donations that aid in strengthening the health and vibrancy of our community.”Leo dismissed the idea his donations were aimed at buying acceptance from a skeptical community, saying people “can judge for themselves why I do what I do.”It isn’t just Leo’s philanthropy that is controversial. His business at local establishments presents a quandary for shop owners and service workers. Many said they oppose Leo’s political positions, but they need his money to sustain their enterprises, allowing shops and restaurants that once closed during frigid winters to stay open longer.Leo is such a sensitive topic that multiple shop owners declined to be interviewed about the wealthy conservative lawyer, explaining they did not want to damage their relationship with him by discussing how his views conflicted with their own and the internal conflict his business causes.Leo, a devout Roman Catholic, has also used money to influence the island’s Catholic churches.Sacred Spaces Foundation, a nonprofit that counts Leo as its president and sole member, purchased St. Ignatius of Loyola Catholic Church in Northeast Harbor for $2.65 million in 2023 from the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, according to records obtained from the county government. The church now holds one service a week during the summer, when Northeast Harbor is busiest.Leo is a regular at another parish, Holy Redeemer, a large stone sanctuary in Bar Harbor where his wife is the head of the music ministry. His presence has driven off some longtime congregants, residents said.Lindy Stretch, an 80-year-old who converted to Catholicism at Holy Redeemer over a decade ago, left the congregation because of what she said was Leo’s growing influence in the church. “I just couldn’t stand to watch that,” Stretch said.Asked about people leaving the island church, Leo wrote he was “thankful for every person who takes the time to come to Holy Redeemer and is striving to be in union with the church and Christ, regardless of what they do or believe in their private lives.”Not everyone is upset about Leo’s Maine move. Though the island’s population is liberal — over 70% of residents voted against Trump in 2024 — Republicans in the state have come to Leo’s defense.House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, who represents a district just off the island, excoriated the protesters in an op-ed and heralded Leo in an interview for “sticking to his beliefs and donating to the causes he believes in.”Since 2020, Leo’s network has funneled over $1 million to conservative causes in the state, including around $800,000 to a policy institute that funds a conservative website and over $300,000 to a conservative state representative’s political network.Those donations have only deepened the opposition to Leo among his most frequent protesters, they said.Most who gathered in October to protest during the marathon have lost count of how often they have met outside Leo’s estate. They have come so frequently they have a routine — each standing in the same place, chanting the same slogans and waving the same signs.Though energized, they have come to accept they may never drive Leo from the island.“He is succeeding,” admitted Bo Greene, a 63-year-old who lives in Bar Harbor, citing the way nonprofits have taken his money. “We are making him uncomfortable, and he hates us,” she said. “But he is still here.”After the last marathoner had plodded by, the women collected their trash and packed away their puppet and signs before heading home.A few hours later, it was like they had never even been there.Not even their chalk slogans on the road remained: Someone had washed them away.AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.

ere hours after it became clear that Donald Trump was going to beat Kamala Harris for the presidency, the blame game began. And there is certainly a lot of blame to go around: On Joe Biden for not stepping back sooner; on Democrats for so thoroughly losing touch with working-class voters; on progressives for many years of overemphasizing identity politics and the language of social-justice academia over the material needs of average Americans. Voters were obviously frustrated with the economy, immigration, and a general sense of disorder. There is no singular explanation for why Trump won – except, of course, he got more than 270 electoral votes, and in this case, most of the total votes as well.But too many of the election postmortems have treated the results of this race as a kind of up-and-down vote on Democrats, as if Trump’s victory is entirely about Democratic shortcomings. The truth is that voters who turned out on Nov. 5 were also voting for something, and for someone. That person was Donald Trump – a man who has not exactly been shy about his priorities, his bigotries, and his character, a convicted felon who has also been found liable of sexual assault.Read More: What the Media MissedComparing 2020 to 2024 is telling. Four years ago, when Biden beat Trump, the general media narrative was that Democrats had done the right thing by choosing the moderate white guy. Democratic Party leaders seemed to agree, and the party’s left flank became increasingly marginalized. Republicans, by contrast, had run a candidate who lost the popular vote twice in a row and had just been bested by a gaffe-prone man who had never inspired much in the way of voter excitement, and their reaction was to triple down on Trump. There were no big public postmortems and mea culpas. If anything, Trump only gained power, taking over the RNC (his daughter-in-law became its co-chair) and leaning harder into MAGA politics. Trump’s GOP didn’t remake itself to be more appealing to the median voter. They may have professionalized their organization a bit more, but their core message stayed the same. They bulldozed forward and assumed voters would come to them.Voters did. Exit polls are notoriously unreliable, but they do seem to show that Trump retained his support from white working-class voters, and especially from white men and white women without college degrees. He also made significant gains with voters of color (and Latino men in particular), the continuation of a shift that was clear in 2020 to anyone who was watching. This is despite the cloud of bigotry that surrounds Trump and his team and the well-publicized chaos and cruelty of his first administration. It may be true that these voters are rejecting Democrats, and preliminary data suggest that turnout in some Democratic strongholds was down. But millions of voters didn’t stay home. Despite Jan. 6, four criminal indictments, and Trump not making many major changes in his policy positions or campaign strategy after his 2020 loss, they got out and they voted for him.Read More: What a Second Trump Term Means for the ConstitutionThis is not to argue that Democrats should simply press forward and ignore what is clearly deep voter satisfaction. It is to say that Trump has been a looming presence in American political life for a decade now, and voters have some idea of who they’re putting in charge. Consider that Americans turning 30 next year have never been able to vote in an American presidential election in which Donald Trump was not a candidate. He’s not a blustery newcomer; he’s an institution, and at this point, he is the Republican Party. He trumpets his loosely drawn policy schemes – mass deportation, tariffs on Chinese goods – at every rally and on every media appearance. Given that America’s lowest-information voters tend to be Trump’s core constituency, it wouldn’t be surprising if many of them didn’t know, say, the minutiae of Project 2025 or the plan to dismantle the administrative state utilizing a unitary theory of the executive. They also may not have any idea about what his tariff plan might do to consumer prices, or that the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid are now on the chopping block, or what his mass deportation scheme would mean for things like construction costs and economic productivity – not to mention the price of food. But it’s hard to imagine that voters are ignorant about his headliner policies, including tariffs and immigration. And at some point, if voters choose not to learn much about the people they’re electing to power outside of a general vibe, that’s not the fault of Democrats or liberals. It’s certainly Democrats’ and liberals’ problem – but I’m not sure they’re the primary ones causing it.It is true, of course, that given the fractured media environment, not everyone is getting the same information or analysis of it. And when you win half the votes in the country, it means that all kinds of people elected you. There is no singular story of the Trump voter. But even if every voter doesn't know every policy detail, it’s hard to imagine that a critical mass of people who cast their ballots for Trump don’t, like everyone else, see Trump’s vanity and venality and strongman aims.The dark truth is that a lot of voters seem to want a strongman in charge, so long as that strongman seems to be working in their interests – and against those they deem enemies, or at least disposable.That Democrats did better downballot is another data point in support of the argument that voters were voting for Trump, and not just against Democrats. It is undeniably true that the Democratic brand is tarnished, and that Democrats need to figure out how to resume appealing to a broader swath of the American public. But Democratic unpopularity doesn’t fully explain the election results. Voters liking Trump and wanting him in office is very clearly a big part of the story.Read More: Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Here's a Plan to Fight BackWhen Americans think of authoritarian leaders, we may turn to history: To Hitler in Germany, Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, Stalin in the former USSR. The narrative about these leaders is that they seized power and terrorized their nations (and, certainly in Hitler and Stalin’s case, well beyond their borders); these authoritarians, the story goes, were essentially forced on their own people, who were victims of their regimes. In truth, though, authoritarians – including history’s most notorious – often enjoy significant support, at least for a period. Globally, authoritarianism remains pretty popular, and it’s more popular in the U.S. than in many comparatively wealthy nations. The core authoritarian voter is both right-leaning and has lower levels of education – two characteristics of the core Trump voter. And a broader authoritarian worldview has been predictive of support for Trump.The idea that voters were simply rejecting Democrats and getting hoodwinked by Trump doesn’t track with the facts.It also doesn’t track with history. The American South was essentially an authoritarian state until quite recently, as Black voters were legally and then practically barred from political participation. The states of the Confederacy have been the most stubbornly authoritarian and anti-democratic in America. As Democrats flipped from supporting Southern authoritarianism to trying to dismantle it, white Southern voters flipped from Democrat to Republican. This was not an accident; it was a policy preference. The same holds true here – and authoritarian preferences, or least tolerances, seem to have extended far above the Mason-Dixon.There is a kind of condescension that many liberal political analysts and talking heads heap onto conservative voters, and it’s not the coastal elitism we hear so much about. It is this exactly dynamic: An assumption that these voters have chosen badly and simply don’t know what they’re choosing; that Democrats have lost them, not that Republicans – and Trump specifically – won them over.Trump voters have agency. They have lived through three Trump election cycles, and have had more exposure to the man than to just about any other politician in America. To a one, they got up off their couches to vote for the guy, showing up at their local polling station or at least walking to their mailbox.But that agency doesn’t mean that we have to accept a lurch toward authoritarianism just because some voters within a democratic system are OK with it. It also doesn’t mean these voters’ views are static. Right now, they’re buying what Trump is selling, and it’s worth Democrats’ time to figure out not only what appeals about that, but how they might better sell their own core values. The job isn’t for Democrats to chase Trump voters by contorting themselves beyond recognition to appeal to conservatives. It is to convince more of the public that liberal values and ideals – democracy, fairness, opportunity, equality, a strong social safety net, and so on – should win out over a conservative politics of fear, control, isolation, and lack of support. And the job of media outlets and political analysts is to be curious about Trump voters and honest – with themselves and the public – about what these voters actually cast their ballots for.CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM

CONTENT: The deluge of goodbye messages from people leaving X began shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory last week. In explaining their decision, many in the exodus cited the same thing: The huge support Elon Musk, the social media service’s owner, gave the Republican candidate during the campaign and the increasing nastiness on his site.Jody Avrigan, a podcast host and media producer with 50,000 followers on X, said on rival social media service Threads, that he was done using X, because “Elon Musk is a pretty destructive force in our society and politics, I want no part of him.” Nicole Wallace, an anchor on MSNBC with over 1 million followers on X, said on live TV that she’d “deleted Twitter today as an act of self preservation.” Tee Wattress said on Threads she’d been on X for 15 years sharing comedic takes on pop culture and reality TV, but “to see it turn into the hell scape that it is today has been devastating.” Even the author and very active X user Stephen King joined Threads, telling his 7 million X followers that he was leaving the platform. “Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic.”The large number of people swearing off X for other services may spell the end to social media as we know it. Instead of just of a tiny number of extremely popular sites for posting news, opinions, and memes, as has been the case for more than a decade, a number of new options are gaining millions of users, such Threads, owned by Facebook parent Meta, and Bluesky.Daily users of X, previously known as Twitter, have declined consistently since Musk acquired it in 2022. Last year, it had roughly 250 million daily active users and Musk claimed that the total would grow to 1 billion in 2024. On election day last week, X had only 162 million daily users—and even that was a yearly high, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm that tracks the platform. A day later, that number had already dropped by 5 million, to 157 million daily users.Under Musk’s ownership, X has lost an average of 14% of its users monthly, according to Sensor Tower. Despite the slight boost in daily users on the day of the election, an “elongated slide in active users” has continued, Sensor Tower’s research lead Seema Shah told Fortune.Shortly after taking over X, Musk made major changes to the platform to advance what he described as “free speech,” whittling down the hundreds of people that once worked on content moderation for Twitter to just a handful of contract employees, reinstating openly white supremacist or otherwise vitriolic personalities, and boosting only accounts that paid to be verified, effectively gamifying the entire platform. He also tilted the algorithm to favor inflammatory posts and conservative flash points, gleefully joining the fray himself, often passing along political and racial conspiracy theories to his 200 million followers.Late in the recent presidential campaign, Musk overtly joined forces with Trump by campaigning for him and donating heavily to ensure a Trump victory, using X as a tool to that end. He has since been by Trump’s side in Florida and has been rewarded by the President-elect as the co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which shares an acronym with a cryptocurrency Musk often promotes.For many users, such a platform, whatever it may have once been, is no longer fun or useful. And it’s set off the latest chorus of people proclaiming their exit from X—for good this time, even if many have decided to keep their accounts live, but vow not to post anything more on them.“There has been a steady drift away from X for a while,” Jonathan Bellack, senior director of Harvard University’s Applied Social Media Lab that’s part of the Berkman Klein Center, told Fortune. “And yes, we’re seeing more people doing it more loudly at the moment, but people have been leaving for months and months. Now, I wonder if people are choosing to leave because of their beliefs, or because the experience on the platform has gotten worse.”This X diaspora has coincided with the rising influence of other forms of media, like podcasts, long-form video, group chats, and comments sections on YouTube and Discord, for instance. It’s also come amid the increasing adoption of newly-founded social media platforms. Today, many public personalities and journalists—long the backbone of Twitter and X—post the same thing across Threads, Bluesky, and X, hedging their bets on what may go viral where.For years, Twitter enjoyed near immunity from new rivals because its network effect was so strong. The more people who used it, the more useful it became and the more others therefore wanted to join. That flywheel spun for a long time, keeping social media startups and even behemoths like Meta, from even attempting to directly compete. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg quipped a decade ago that Twitter was “a clown car that drove into a goldmine.” When Musk started to take the wheels off of Twitter, Zuckerberg put 15 engineers to work building a veritable clone now known as Threads.Whatever people’s reasons for leaving X, the two most likely places for people to land is either Threads or Bluesky, a startup initiated by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Both platforms debuted last year and are currently jockeying for first and second place in Apple’s App store for most-downloaded free apps in the U.S. TikTok and WhatsApp, also owned by Meta, are in the top 10 as well. Meanwhile, X is in 29th place, behind other social apps like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta. No third party research service tracks when users delete an app from their phone. But SimilarWeb found that at least 115,000 users deactivated their X accounts via the web the day after the recent election. That same day, Google Search interest in the phrase “Delete X” rose 150% and has continued to grow by double digit percentage points each day since, according to Huge, a design and technology company that conducts custom research. Even news outlet The Guardian said this week it was abandoning all 80 of his official accounts, with a collective 27 million followers, due to the increase in “disturbing content promoted or found on the platform.”Another data point is anecdotal: Over the past week, many top X users say they’ve lost significant numbers of followers, ranging from dozens to hundreds or even thousands. Brent Troderian, who has over 150,000 followers on X, said on Threads that he’s lost about 1,000 followers since the election. Another well-known figure on X, Aaron Rupar, who writes a newsletter on politics and media, said he hemorrhaged 10,000 of his nearly 1 million followers last week. “While I’m not above a bad tweet or two, I don’t think it’s anything I posted,” he wrote.Although there has been speculation online that some of these declines could be related to bots or inauthentic accounts suddenly leaving or being deleted from the platform, there is no clear evidence to support the notion.In any case, such follower losses coincide with growth in activity on rival platforms. New users of Threads in the last month grew 394% year over year, according to Sensor Tower. Meta said in October the service had reached 275 million monthly active users. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram who also oversees Threads, said Thursday that the platform had added another 15 million users so far in November, and was “going on three months with more than a million sign ups a day.”While Bluesky has far fewer users, it’s been a trending topic on X and Threads over the last week as people discussed where there were heading while leaving X. Since the election, it has added almost 1 million new users, to a total of nearly 15 million.TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have all added users as well each month over the last year, from 3% to 10%, according to Sensor Tower.Despite all of the apparent momentum away from X, and the manipulation of its content algorithm in favor of right-wing politics and Musk himself, at least some of the people who may be leaving X are being replaced by new users. It’s possible there is a sort of swap going on—use among people fed up with the pro-Trump drift and Musk’s omnipresence is, to some extent, being covered by people who are attracted to exactly that.“Although X has experienced this elongated decline in overall US active users over the past few years, it has seen a sizable uptick in new users, or those who had previously never registered a session on X,” Shah of Sensor Tower told Fortune. According to Sensor Tower, new mobile app users for X jumped 17% in October, among the few notable increases it’s seen since Musk’s takeover.While this isn’t enough to offset X’s sustained loss in users since Musk’s acquisition, the overall migration among social media platforms is part and parcel to a new era of online fragmentation. This online splintering is taking with it some of the cultural and media power that had coalesced around what was Twitter, according to Bellack of Harvard, and it’s likely that no one platform or type of media will take up that position ever again.“Twitter always had a level of influence that was disproportionate to its number of users – it had a public square feeling, yes, but there’s no reason that’s the only way social media can work,” Bellack said. “People leaving X, the fragmentation and people sorting themselves in other places, it’s just reinforcing the notion that there will no longer be one definitive platform, and that’s probably a good thing.”Are you a tech employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

CONTENT: Beyoncé Knowles-Carter will not only go down in history books; now the record-breaking superstar and her legacy will be the subject of a new course at Yale University.The single-credit course titled “Beyoncé Makes History: Black Radical Tradition, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music” will be offered at the Ivy League school next year.Taught by the university’s African American Studies Professor Daphne Brooks, the course will take a look at the megastar's profound cultural impact. In the class, students will take a deep dive into Beyoncé's career and examine how she has brought on more awareness and engagement in social and political doctrines.The class will utilize the singer's expansive music catalogue, spanning from her 2013 self-titled album up to her history making album "Cowboy Carter" as tools for learning. Brooks also plans to use Beyoncé's music as a vehicle to teach students about other notable Black intellectuals throughout history, such as Toni Morrison and Frederick Douglass.As fans know, Beyoncé, who is already the most awarded artist in Grammy history, recently made history again as the most nominated artist with a total of 99, after receiving 11 more nods at the 2025 Grammy Awards for her eighth studio album "Cowboy Carter." She released the album March 29 and has since made history, broken multiple records and put a huge spotlight on Black country artists and the genre's roots.Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.“[This class] seemed good to teach because [Beyoncé] is just so ripe for teaching at this moment in time,” Brooks told Yale Daily News. “The number of breakthroughs and innovations she’s executed and the way she’s interwoven history and politics and really granular engagements with Black cultural life into her performance aesthetics and her utilization of her voice as a portal to think about history and politics — there’s just no one like her.”And it's not the first time college professors have taught courses centered around Beyoncé. There have actually been quite a few.Riché Richardson, professor of African American literature at Cornell University and the Africana Research Center, created a class called "Beyoncénation" to explore her impact on sectors including fashion, music, business, social justice and motherhood.“Beyoncé has made a profound impact on national femininity,” Richardson told USA TODAY. “It’s interesting because traditionally for Black women, there's been this sense that there are certain hardships that they have encountered [and therefore] marriage and education have been seen as being mutually exclusive.”And Erik Steinskog, associate professor of musicology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, also felt compelled to create a Beyoncé course back in 2017 centered on race and gender.Steinskog looked at the singer's music and ideologies through an international lens."I, at the time and still, see Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' as one of the masterpieces of the 21st century of music," he said. "I wanted to introduce Black feminism to my students as sort of a contrast to how feminism is often perceived in Europe."Follow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.

CONTENT: Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:___Nov. 17The Washington Post on a way forward for student loan reliefMany Democrats thought President Joe Biden’s efforts to forgive vast swaths of student debt would be both good policy and good politics. But their hopes of winning over young voters by relieving college loan burdens did not pan out. The Democratic ticket not only failed to make any gains among 18-to-29-year-olds relative to its 2020 performance but also lost ground in the age group.Student debt remains a real issue: The $1.6 trillion in federal loans weighing on 42.8 million borrowers acts as a drag on the economy and has trapped millions of Americans in cycles of long-term default. However, Democrats, and everyone else, must learn two lessons from Mr. Biden’s experience: Blanket relief for borrowers, regardless of their income and ability to pay, strikes many voters, correctly, as inefficient and inequitable. And reforming the student debt program is a job best done in the halls of Congress, not the Oval Office.Mr. Biden’s initial attempt to cancel almost $400 billion in loans — which the Supreme Court rejected — stretched executive power beyond appropriate constitutional bounds. It was also regressive, since it used tax dollars drawn from the general population to subsidize debts freely undertaken by people who gained enhanced earning power as a result. For many Americans who had already paid off their debts, the policy felt unfair. Even for intended beneficiaries, the disappointment of its failure outweighed any goodwill Mr. Biden might have earned in trying to help. A survey in June found that fewer than one-third of U.S. adults approved of how he handled the issue. Forty percent disapproved.After losing at the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden developed a more nuanced plan. His administration shifted toward a program called Saving on a Valuable Education, or Save. This program lowered monthly payments for people on an already existing repayment plan (called Revised Pay as You Earn, or Repaye) and shortened the amount of time that borrowers would need to make those payments before the remainder of the loan was canceled (from 20 or 25 years to just a decade). Those terms were expensive (about $230 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office) and too generous: An Urban Institute analysis found that nearly half of bachelor’s degree recipients in the program would pay less than half of their loan. But at least they were better targeted to help student borrowers in need than Mr. Biden’s initial forgiveness ploy.Still, even this more moderate approach has hit legal roadblocks. Federal judges blocked Save from moving forward after a group of Republican-led states claimed Mr. Biden’s program would deprive them of revenue. In August, the Supreme Court refused to intervene, so the plan is on hold. The litigation illustrates the futility of trying to reallocate hundreds of billions of dollars in public money via executive fiat, especially with conservatives firmly in control of the Supreme Court.Mr. Biden’s plan was always at risk of being torn down by the next Republican administration. And that administration is now at hand, to be headed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized Mr. Biden’s student loan policy as a “total catastrophe” and “unfair” to Americans who already paid off their loans. In Mr. Trump’s first term, he sought to increase monthly payments. Should he seek to do so again, student borrowers will have endured a roller coaster of complicated policy changes, threatening their financial stability.The Biden administration did achieve some of its goals. It canceled more than $175 billion in student debt, primarily by reducing administrative hurdles in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, without running afoul of the courts. It also proposed new regulations that would crack down on for-profit schools, which account for a disproportionate share of loan defaults. However, because of the Democrats’ larger political defeat, these policies are now at risk of reversal under a Trump administration. And the task of devising a broader income-based debt relief plan remains. So, too, does the challenge of incentivizing colleges and universities to contain their ever-growing costs.Mr. Biden’s Save program could be a good starting point for members of Congress to negotiate a more modest income-based repayment system that is fully paid for and targets the neediest, along with other higher-education reforms. Lawmakers should focus on expanding existing tuition assistance for low-income families, emphasizing aid, such as Pell Grants, that does not create future debt burdens. Such legislation would not only help graduates manage their loans, but also restore some faith among voters that student loan reform really is about good policy, not just good politics.ONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/17/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-trump/___Nov. 14The New York Times on Donald Trump's choices for national leadershipDonald Trump has demonstrated his lack of fitness for the presidency in countless ways, but one of the clearest is in the company he keeps, surrounding himself with fringe figures, conspiracy theorists and sycophants who put fealty to him above all else. This week, a series of cabinet nominations by Mr. Trump showed the potential dangers posed by his reliance on his inner circle in the starkest way possible.For three of the nation’s highest-ranking and most vital positions, Mr. Trump said he would appoint loyalists with no discernible qualifications for their jobs, people manifestly inappropriate for crucial positions of leadership in law enforcement and national security.The most irresponsible was his choice for attorney general. To fill the post of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, the president-elect said he would nominate Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.Yes, that Matt Gaetz.The one who called for the abolishment of the F.B.I. and the entire Justice Department if they didn’t stop investigating Mr. Trump. The one who was among the loudest congressional voices in denying the results of the 2020 election, who said he was “proud of the work” that he and other deniers did on Jan. 6, 2021, and who praised the Capitol rioters as “patriotic Americans” who had no intention of committing violence. The one whose move to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023 paralyzed his own party’s leadership of the House for nearly a month.Mr. Gaetz, who submitted his letter of resignation from Congress on Wednesday after his nomination was announced, was the target of a yearslong federal sex-trafficking investigation that led to an 11-year prison term for one of his associates, though he denied any involvement. The Justice Department closed that investigation, but the House Ethics Committee is still looking into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, improper acceptance of gifts and obstruction of government investigations of his conduct. Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, blamed Mr. Gaetz for his ouster, on the grounds that Mr. Gaetz “wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.”This is the man Mr. Trump has selected to lead the 115,000-person agency that he has called the most important in the federal government, a position whose enforcement role could cause the most trouble for any president with corrupt intent. Even for Mr. Trump, it was a stunning demonstration of his disregard for basic competence and government experience, and of his duty to lead the executive branch in a sober and patriotic way. It will now be up to the Senate to say he has gone too far and reject this nomination.Mr. Trump’s list of appointments is just getting started but already includes two other unqualified nominations that he announced this week: former Representative Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense.Ms. Gabbard, who previously represented Hawaii in the House and regularly appears on Fox News, is not only devoid of intelligence experience but has repeatedly taken positions in direct opposition to American foreign policy and national security interests. She has appeared on several occasions to side with strongmen like President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.Mr. Hegseth, a co-host of “Fox & Friends,” is perhaps even more unqualified, given the gravity — not to mention the budget — of the post he would assume. He enjoys some support from enlisted service members and veterans, but outside of serving two tours as an Army infantryman in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as time at Guantánamo Bay, Mr. Hegseth has no experience in government or national defense.“He’s never run a big institution, much less one of the largest and most hidebound on the planet,” the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal wrote Wednesday. “He has no experience in government outside the military, and no small risk is that the bureaucracy will eat him alive.” The board went on to call Mr. Hegseth a “culture warrior” at a time when there are much bigger security issues for the Pentagon to be focused on.It’s far from certain Mr. Hegseth could even obtain the security clearances required for the job. He has said he was one of a dozen National Guard members removed from service at President Biden’s inauguration in 2021 because of concerns that he was an extremist — possibly because of a tattoo he wears that is popular among white supremacists.These are some of the most consequential roles in government, protecting the country from military and terrorist threats, investigating domestic criminal conspiracies, and prosecuting thousands of federal crimes every year. Yet to fill them Mr. Trump has resorted to people whose only eligibility for office is an apparent willingness to say yes to his every demand.Mr. Gaetz in particular has joined Mr. Trump in expressing a commitment to exacting vengeance against anyone they believe has done them wrong. Mr. Trump began his campaign by saying “I am your retribution,” and Mr. Gaetz broadcasts nothing so much as that. He has no business leading an agency with the role of combating crime, fraud, violations of civil rights and threats to national security, among many other things.In Mr. Trump’s first term, the department was protected by career prosecutors and other civil servants who understood that their primary obligation was to the dictates of the Constitution, not to the whims of the president. But Mr. Trump has promised to purge people like that from his second administration.The possibility of extreme appointments like these was the reason the Constitution gives the Senate the right to refuse its consent to a president’s wishes. Last week, Republicans won control of the chamber. Now they will be confronted with an immediate test: Will they stand up for the legislative branch and for the American system of checks and balances? Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have already expressed strong skepticism of Mr. Gaetz’s nomination, and others have declined to express their support.Mr. Trump clearly expects the Senate to simply roll over and ignore its responsibilities. He wants to turn the leaders of major important agencies into his deputies, remaking the federal government into a Trump Inc. organization chart entirely subordinate to him. He recently demanded that the Senate give him the ability to make recess appointments, a way of bypassing the Senate’s consent process when the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or more.Even Republican senators refused to consent to that demand during his first term, to preserve their constitutional role, and on Wednesday Senate Republicans voted to reject as their leader Rick Scott of Florida, who said he would have no problem allowing recess appointments. Instead they chose John Thune of South Dakota, who is far more likely to uphold his chamber’s right to refuse consent of president nominations.In Mr. Trump’s second term, senators will immediately be confronted with an extreme set of appointments even worse than those of the first term. That makes it all the more important that they preserve the ability to say no.ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/opinion/editorials/matt-gaetz-nomination-senate.html___Nov. 14The Boston Globe on extending federal Pell grants to short-term workforce trainingBenjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology, a private two-year college in Boston, offers an 800-hour certificate program in HVAC and refrigeration. President and CEO Aisha Francis said she’d like to break out segments of the program to create continuing education classes for HVAC technicians seeking to improve their skills — for example, offering a class in heat pump installation. But the school, which attracts primarily Black and Latino men interested in the trades, can’t make it work financially. About half the school’s students receive federal Pell grants to help finance their education, and short-term certificate classes are ineligible for Pell funding.“Most of our students are very low income, so even though they want the skill set, they’re not able to pay for them,” Francis said.Many fields today are facing workforce shortages. At the same time, there are students seeking a quick credential to enter the job market. Short-term certificate programs can help students get an entry-level job or gain new skills. For example, a student interested in medicine can train as a certified nursing assistant or emergency medical technician, then earn money while deciding whether they want to continue climbing the health care career ladder.Yet federal Pell grants — the major source of financial aid for low-income students — aren’t awarded for programs that are shorter than 600 hours or less than 15 weeks. That leaves low-income students, who are often those seeking certificates, scrambling to pay out of pocket and schools searching for alternative funding. Schools may offer fewer courses because interested students can’t afford to pay.Congress has been considering bipartisan bills to expand Pell eligibility for short-term classes. Passing legislation would be a win for Republicans advocating for more workforce-related education and for Democrats seeking to expand educational access for low-income students. More importantly, it would help students gain marketable skills and employers fill open jobs.While legitimate concerns have been raised about ensuring that Pell-eligible credential programs are high-quality, legislation could address those concerns by establishing objective standards programs must meet. For example, programs that train students for a licensing exam could only retain eligibility if a certain percentage of graduates pass the exam within a reasonable time frame after graduation. Other metrics could involve job placement rates, program completion rates, or enhanced earnings.“It’s increasingly clear that most jobs require some degree of postsecondary training, and it’s been hard to develop viable alternative pathways to college for students who are not enrolling in four-year degree programs without financial support,” said Martin West, academic dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Expanding Pell, West said, “could create innovation in that space.”Francis said Franklin Cummings Tech would offer more classes in construction-related fields like land surveying or blueprint reading if they were Pell eligible. And she expects that some people who earn short-term certificates would advance to other degrees. “We know these kinds of measures actually push more people into higher education,” Francis said. “It’s just a matter of will. Do we want to help more people get better educated or not?”The biggest proponents of expanding Pell have been community colleges. At North Shore Community College, around 500 students are enrolled in short-term professional programs in areas like health care and information technology. Jennifer James Price, assistant vice president of employer relations for the college, said she works with local hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes, which are desperate for nursing assistants, phlebotomists, and other program graduates. To pay for these programs, the school has been chasing grants, but those aren’t reliable, and tuition for a health care certification can cost up to $3,000. (The state’s free community college program also doesn’t apply to certificate classes.) “It doesn’t build a steady expectation for students or businesses in the North Shore where (classes are) happening at a low cost all the time,” Price said.There is evidence that paying for workforce training works. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, Massachusetts created a $15 million state fund to pay for workforce training in high-need fields at community colleges. According to a report by the Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges, 3,359 students completed these programs, the majority of them in health care, and 2,404 of those graduates (66 percent) found a job or were enrolled in continuing education within 90 days of program completion.Bills introduced in Congress would authorize Pell grants for students enrolled in programs with at least 150 hours, with guardrails to ensure the programs are high-quality and fulfill employer needs. There has been some dispute over whether to include for-profit colleges, which have historically charged students more money than nonprofits with worse outcomes. Guardrails that restrict eligibility to programs that meet objective criteria — like the ability to pass a licensing exam or get a job — would address concerns about quality, regardless of tax status.There would be an estimated $1.7 billion cost to US taxpayers over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. As the House considered advancing the bill earlier this year, Republicans inserted a poison pill, proposing to pay for the expansion by restricting federal loans to students at schools with large endowments. Give the size of the federal budget, experts say there are undoubtedly other, less controversial sources of money that can be tapped to pay to expand Pell, which is already an approximately $25 billion-a-year program.Expanding Pell eligibility to short-term certificate programs would help students, schools, and employers. Congress should resist the temptation to play politics and pass the policy.ONLINE: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/14/opinion/pell-grants-short-term-certificate-workforce/___Nov. 17The Wall Street Journal says economic disruption is bad policy for Donald TrumpDonald Trump ’s cabinet nominees so far reveal a desire to disrupt Washington, and disruption is needed in many places. But as he mulls his choices for Treasury and the economic-policy posts, the question markets will ask is whether he will disrupt the policy mix that was successful in his first term.The voter election surveys make clear that Mr. Trump won his second term above all else on the economy. Voters rejected the results of Bidenomics, especially inflation and a decline in real incomes. They recalled the strong investment and job market and rising wages across all income levels of the pre-Covid economy. Mr. Trump’s second term success or failure will depend on restoring those results.That’s the hope behind the market’s bullish initial response to Mr. Trump’s re-election. Investors anticipate a return of animal spirits as the pall of Democratic tax increases and regulatory coercion is lifted. But economic and financial risks remain, and they’ll require careful judgment, not blow-it-all-up rhetoric.That’s why it’s strange to hear Elon Musk lobby Mr. Trump that the next Treasury secretary shouldn’t be someone who favors “business as usual.” What he means by that isn’t clear beyond favoring one personality over another, and Mr. Musk may not know. Fiscal and monetary policy aren’t his specialty.Our concern isn’t personalities so much as Mr. Musk’s apparent belief in economic-policy disruption for its own sake. Treasury isn’t the Education Department, or Defense, and financial markets don’t want to trade one form of policy uncertainty for another. Steady and knowledgeable economic policy hands are needed if Mr. Trump wants to succeed.One risk ahead is the tax bill that needs to pass next year to extend the 2017 tax reform. With narrow GOP majorities in Congress, that won’t be easy. All the more so because Mr. Trump campaigned on new tax cuts (on tips, overtime, Social Security benefits) that will be impossible to afford unless Republicans want to sign up for an even larger deficit blowout than under President Biden.Extending the 2017 reform more or less intact might be the best policy. That reform has recouped more tax revenue than the critics and Congressional scorekeepers claimed, and it will continue to do so if the economy keeps growing. But piling on too many tax giveaways that won’t improve the incentive to work and invest could make tax reform difficult to pass and spook the bond markets. The U.S. deficit as a share of GDP in the last fiscal year was 6.4%, which is unheard of in a growing economy without a war or pandemic.We assume someone has told Mr. Trump that disinflation seems to have stalled. Long bond rates have climbed since the Federal Reserve cut short-term rates by 50 basis points in September. The 10-year Treasury yield is now above 4.4%, while the average 30-year mortgage rate is nearing 7.5%, higher than on Election Day. This means the Fed’s rate-cutting spree may soon have to end, lest inflation make a comeback on Mr. Trump’s watch.The largest uncertainty is the President’s trade policy. There’s no doubt he will impose tariffs of some kind on Chinese goods and seems determined to impose some broader tariff across all imports. Whatever one thinks of tariffs as a policy tool, they add uncertainty to business investment decisions.CEOs whose companies might be affected will wait on investments until they see the policy. Even then, they have to be wary about retaliation by other countries that might affect their exports or their ability to import components. This will slow the return of animal spirits.Unlike other policy positions, the Treasury Secretary needs an understanding of financial markets, which nowadays are global. A blowup in the foreign-exchange markets somewhere can affect the U.S. economy, and new financial investments like crypto need careful watching. Mr. Trump has promised to ease political control over these markets, but no one should think they are risk free. Blowups somewhere are inevitable, and a Treasury secretary needs the experience to deal with the fallout in a way that reassures markets.Mr. Trump’s first term until Covid was an overall economic success, as his tax reform and deregulation overcame the drag from tariffs. Markets responded well to his victory because they hope for a repeat. But that requires sound policy, not willy-nilly disruption.ONLINE: https://www.wsj.com/opinion/disruption-wont-work-at-treasury-trump-nomination-musk-63c5b8f9?mod=editorials_article_pos1___Nov. 15The Guardian says rich nations in the global north owe “climate debt” to poorer nationsMore than a century of burning coal, oil and gas has fueled intense heatwaves, prolonged droughts, heavier rains and devastating floods. To prevent even more severe impacts, the UN global climate summit, Cop29, must deliver tangible results to keep global temperature rises below 2C – the limit defined in the 2015 Paris agreement. Achieving this goal means human societies can only emit a finite amount of additional carbon dioxide, known as the world’s “carbon budget”.Developed nations have exceeded their carbon budgets, while developing countries remain within theirs. Carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, turning past unchecked fossil fuel use into a costly planetary bill. Between 1870 and 2019, the US, EU, Russia, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia – home to just 15% of the global population – accounted for over 60% of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.This underscores the climate debt that rich nations in the global north owe to poorer nations. This reality – rather than oil and gas lobbying – should focus minds at Cop29 in Azerbaijan, where leaders must forge a new global climate finance plan by next week. Economists estimate that developing nations need $1tn annually by 2030, a figure that reflects the scale of the climate crisis. Yet there is little sign the rich world will contribute its fair share.A stronger, more unified approach is needed. Many of Africa’s environmental NGOs argue that the continent has been sidelined in global industrial shifts, particularly in green industrialisation, due to its lack of a robust manufacturing base and its role as a raw materials supplier. While advanced economies dominate green innovation, Africa faces significant hurdles, including limited technology transfer, expensive financing and weak governance.The economist Fadhel Kaboub, who advises the Kenyan thinktank Power Shift Africa, sees Cop29 as an opportunity to strike a transformative deal – if the global south can unite and negotiate for the technology and resources it needs to reposition itself in the world economy. Prof Kaboub describes the current climate finance model as “economic entrapment”. The evidence is stark: Africa holds 40% of the world’s renewable energy resources but attracts just 2% of global investments. With 20 out of 38 low-income African nations in or near debt distress, high borrowing costs and a shrinking manufacturing base leave the continent dependent on imports for life’s essentials.These challenges span the developing world, demanding grants, technology transfers and debt cancellation. Prof Kaboub says Donald Trump’s return to the White House could be a chance for countries in the global south to cooperate and forge a bold deal: to double their industrial footprint with green growth, powered by western technology, in exchange for critical minerals essential for the rich world’s energy transition. Africa, holding 20% to 90% of global reserves for 11 such minerals, could lead this shift. The outcome? A greener, richer world, with developing nations becoming key markets for foreign goods and services.Mr Trump may find the allure of crafting the “ deal of the century” impossible to resist. Others – such as the EU or China – might also be ready to take up such an offer. Cop29 must mark a turning point where developing nations, united, demand a fair and transformative global partnership for a sustainable future. The stakes couldn’t be higher, and neither could the opportunity to reshape the future.ONLINE: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/the-guardian-view-on-un-climate-talks-rich-and-poor-nations-can-strike-a-win-win-deal___24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

CONTENT: One Democratic congressman wasn’t surprised by Tuesday’s election results.Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.Representative Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, cut me off before I even finished my question: Congressman, were you— “Surprised? No, I was not surprised,” Torres, who represents a poor and working-class district in the Bronx, told me. “Much of my side in politics, and much of the media, was in a state of self-deception. We confused analysis with wishful thinking.”Which is to say, too many in Torres’s party assumed that they were heralds of virtue and endangered democratic values and that Americans would not, as a despairing New York Times columnist put it this week, vote for an “authoritarian grotesquerie.”This, Torres argued, was purest delusion. Inflation and steeply rising rates on credit cards, car loans, and mortgages may not have been President Joe Biden’s fault, but they buffeted Americans. The immigration system was broken, and migrants swamped shelters in big cities. There’s no need to assume—as some commentators have after Donald Trump’s sweeping victory Tuesday—that the United States has a uniquely fallen electorate; across the globe, voters have tossed out governments on the left and right over the disruptions of the past five years. “A majority of Americans disapprove of Biden’s performance and felt they were worse off,” Torres said; Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, “was not responsible for the inflation, but objectively, that was a near-insurmountable disadvantage.”Thomas Chatterton Williams: What the left keeps getting wrongTorres pointed as well to the cumulative toll taken by progressives who for at least a decade have loudly championed cultural causes and chanted slogans that turned off rank-and-file Democrats across many demographics. “Donald Trump had no greater friend than the far left,” Torres told me, “which alienated historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews with absurdities like ‘Defund the police’ or ‘From the river to the sea’ or ‘Latinx.’”The result is the reality that Americans woke up to on Wednesday. The overwhelming majority of counties in the nation, even some of the bluest of blue, had shifted rightward. The Republicans had broken down the door to the Democrats’ house and were sitting in the living room drinking its beer (or wine, as the case might be). On the day after the election, I clicked through a digital election-results map of New Jersey. Biden in 2020 took New Jersey, a Democratic Party bastion, by nearly 16 percentage points over Trump; Harris won the state by a more parsimonious five points. Everywhere, Republicans sanded down Democratic margins. In the state’s northeast corner, across from New York City, Biden had taken prosperous Bergen County by 16 percentage points in 2020; Harris took the same county by three points. Far to the south, in Atlantic County, which includes the deteriorating casino capital of Atlantic City, Biden had won by seven points; Trump took it by four points.Torres emphasized that in his view, Harris ran a vigorous and effective campaign, given the circumstances. He did not discern many missteps. Although she sometimes tossed up clouds of vagueness when asked about past positions, she was disciplined and avoided mouthing the buzzwords of the cultural left during her 2024 campaign. But she could not sidestep her previous concessions to liberal cultural fevers, as she discovered when the Trump campaign bludgeoned her with endless commercials highlighting her decision, during her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, to champion state-funded gender-transition surgery for prisoners.In recent election cycles, Democrats have invested much hope that “people of color”—the widely varied and disparate peoples long imagined to be a monolith—would embrace an expansive list of progressive causes and rearrange American politics.Politics, alas, is more complex than simply arranging virtuous ethnic and racial voting blocs, and Trump’s gains this year among nonwhite voters are part of a longer trend. Four years ago, even as Biden triumphed, a majority of Asian and Latino voters in California rejected a ballot proposition that would have restored affirmative action in education and hiring.For some anti-Trump and progressive commentators, the leakage of Latino, Black, and Asian voters from the Democratic column this year registered as a shock, even a betrayal. This week, the MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough and his guest, the Reverend Al Sharpton, both upset with Trump’s triumph, suggested that Harris’s race and gender worked against her. “A lot of Hispanic voters have problems with Black candidates,” Scarborough opined; Black men, Sharpton said, are among “the most sexist” people.To accept such stereotypes requires ignoring piles of contrary evidence. In 2008 and again in 2012, to cite an example, Hispanic voters up and down the Rio Grande Valley in Texas delivered huge electoral margins to President Barack Obama, who is Black. Many millions of Black men, nearly 80 percent of those who cast a ballot, exit polls suggest, voted for Harris this past Tuesday.Black and Latino voters are not the only demographics drawing blame for Trump’s victory. Some commentators have pointed an accusatory finger at white women, suggesting they bear a group guilt for selling out women’s rights. This fails as a matter of fact. Nearly half of white women voted for Harris. But more to the point, telling people how to think and not to think is toxic in politics. Yet many liberal commentators seem unable to help themselves.A week before the election, Marcel Roman, a Harvard government professor, explained on X that he and a Georgetown colleague had discovered that Latino voters deeply dislike being labeled Latinx, a gender-neutral term now widespread in academia. This term also came into use by Democratic politicians eager to establish their bona fides with progressive activists. Alas, voters liked it not so much.Josh Barro: Democrats deserved to loseThis problem seems easily remedied: Refer to voters by the term they prefer—Latino, say, or Hispanic. Roman drew a different conclusion, calling for “political education meant to root out queerphobia in Latino communities.”Professors might heed the words of Representative Ruben Gallego, a Latino Democrat who is currently wrapped in a tight race for a Senate seat in Arizona. Four years ago, I spoke with him about identity politics in his party. A progressive, Gallego is a favorite of Latino activists, who flock from California to work on his campaigns. He told me that he appreciated their help but warned them that if they used the word Latinx when talking to his Latino constituents, he would load them onto the next bus back to Los Angeles.“It’s just important that white liberals don’t impose their thoughts and policies on us,” he told me.And nonwhite liberals too, he might have added.Having lost twice to Trump in three election cycles, and this time watching Republicans reclaim control of the Senate, Democrats might do well to listen carefully and respectfully to the tens of millions of Americans whom they claim to want to represent. This need not entail a turn away from populist economics so much as remaining clear-eyed about self-righteous rhetoric and millennialist demands.The party might pay some heed to Torres, the Bronx representative. A veteran of political wars, he is a progressive Democrat on economic issues and has taken much grief of late from left activists for his vigorous support of Israel. He noted in our conversation that he is strongly in favor of immigration, and his majority-Latino district has many hardworking undocumented residents who need his aid.But he recognizes that the national electorate, not least many Latino and Black voters, now seeks to at least partially close the door and tighten restrictions. He accepts that reality. “You have to recognize that in a democracy, public opinion matters,” he said. “We cannot just assume that we can reshape the world in a utopian way.”In an election year that fell decisively, disastrously short of utopian for Democrats, such advice registers as entirely practical.More StoriesThe Low Comedy of Eric Adams’s IndictmentWhy Trump’s Arlington Debacle Is So Serious

CONTENT: Author JK Rowling has clarified her political views after a social media user accused her of having "far-right" sympathies over her views on transgender women.Over the past few years, the Harry Potter writer has sparked debate—and backlash—over her expressed statements on trans women, leading some activists to brand Rowling a "TERF"—an acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminist.On Sunday, British-born Rowling responded to a person on X, formerly Twitter, who suggested that her politics were more aligned with right-wing ideologies.Newsweek has contacted a representative of Rowling via email for comment."@jk_rowling is far right," read the post. "[I don't care] how many times she pretends she isn't. She gets all of her information from [neo-Nazi] publications and far-right hate groups. [She] believes a far-right conspiracy theory that is basically just 'the Protocols of the elders of Zion,' but for trans [people]."Sharing a lengthy response, Rowling wrote: "You can keep telling yourself this, but you're simply wrong. I'm a left-leaning liberal who's fiercely anti-authoritarian, and if you couldn't deduce that from my work you haven't understood a word of it."I'm not an ideologue. I mistrust ideologies," she continued. "I've never met an ideologue who wasn't prepared to deny a bit of inconvenient truth to keep their world view intact and I include ideologies with which I find myself in broad sympathy. On the other hand, I am an idealist. I believe in human beings. We are undeniably capable of terrible acts, but the evidence is that we are astoundingly collaborative and mutually supportive, especially when times are hard."Rowling went on to state that it's not her values that have changed in recent years, but rather "the political landscape.""What was once my natural home (a pragmatic centre-left party focused on dealing with economic disparity, championing social liberalism and equal rights) is now dominated by an illiberal, identity-based strain of politics I consider elitist, harmful and out of touch with the day-to-day concerns of regular people, particularly women (and I've still lived more than half of my life as a non-wealthy woman, and some of that time was spent in poverty)," she stated."There are women with whom I make common cause in the TERF wars I disagree with on other things. Within obvious limits (sucking up to literal Nazis) I don't particularly care about their personal politics. The reality is that there's currently an assault on women's rights unparalleled in my lifetime, and it's coming from both left and right. If ever there was a time for women across the political spectrum to come together, it is now."The post, which as of press time had garnered more than 3.5 million views, sparked a discussion among X users."The left hates you," read one response. "Why do you still identify with that side? It's interesting to me when folks do this, but it's especially interesting when the greatest writer of the last 50 years does. Which aspects draw you in?""By the old left/right metrics (which I accept have been massively disrupted) I am left wing. Not hard left, but definitely left of centre," Rowling wrote in response. "However, I believe the left in the West has taken a dangerous and self-defeating turn, embracing a form of identity politics that is fundamentally destructive to values the left once respected, especially freedom of speech and fundamental liberalism."I'm not a tribal person, so I haven't embraced those positions because 'my team' has decreed that's what we're doing now. Yes, I've received a lot of blowback from the left for not meekly accepting the new ethos. But principles aren't dictated by other people's approval.""I was never in this to feel part of a team (one of the undersung benefits of being a true introvert)," she added. "So I won't be running to embrace a new team to feel good about myself, because that would be just as insincere as pretending to believe in the identity stuff to keep myself in with the left."Another X user asked if Rowling had any regrets, asking: "Why did you feel the need to insert yourself into a very controversial social issue that you likely knew would alienate so many of your readers?""Because I'm not the Queen Mother," Rowling wrote back. "It is not incumbent on me to be the world's favourite old lady. I'll go down fighting for women and girls, and screw being bland and cosy."In another post, Rowling said that she chose to speak out on certain issues because she "did look around and think, 'It's going to have to be me.' It had to be someone who could take the hit. Too many women lost too much in standing up and it should shame the left that they let that happen."Rowling stirred controversy in 2019 when she publicly supported Maya Forstater, a U.K. tax specialist who was fired over tweets that were deemed by some to be anti-trans.In an essay published on her personal website in June 2020, Rowling shared some of her views on transgender issues.She wrote: "When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman—and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones—then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth."Also in June 2020, Rowling reacted to an article that referred to "people who menstruate," writing on X: "I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?"While some trans activists hit back at Rowling, she stood her ground on the issue.Rowling said on X at the time: "If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn't hate to speak the truth.""I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them," she went on. "I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans. At the same time, my life has been shaped by being female. I do not believe it's hateful to say so."Several actors associated with the Harry Potter franchise have publicly disagreed with her, including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.In July 2021, Rowling stated on then Twitter that she had received a "pipebomb" threat amid an onslaught of attacks over her previous statements about trans women.She has continued to speak out about the way that the internet has "canceled" her, tweeting in support of singer Macy Gray, who in July 2022 made several controversial comments on the definition of a woman.Gray faced backlash on X, prompting Rowling to write in response: "Endless death and rape threats, threats of loss of livelihood, employers targeted, physical harassment, family address posted online with picture of bomb-making manual aren't 'mean comments.' If you don't yet understand what happens to women who stand up on this issue, back off."Ryan Smith is a Newsweek Senior Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on ... read more

CONTENT: Eric DeggansDonald Trump speaks to the media at Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport in Green Bay, Wis., on Oct. 30, 2024.Looking at the media coverage leading to and throughout President-elect Donald Trump’s massive electoral success Tuesday, I wonder if we are seeing — at least a little bit — the impact of politics rendered as entertainment and spectacle.Former Trump press aide Erin Perrine touched on the point Tuesday during the chatty live election night special hosted by ex-NBC anchor Brian Williams on Amazon’s Prime Video. Perrine noted Vice President Kamala Harris may have spent too much time during the campaign focused on her opponent, making the election seem like a referendum on his personality.“Not only are we a deeply divided nation, but we aren’t sure where we want to go directionally at this point,” Perrine said early in the evening, before the size of Trump’s victory was apparent. “It’s a policy versus personality conversation that voters are having with themselves.”Williams’ election special itself seemed to reflect the turn toward spectacle, conducted from a studio set in Los Angeles with huge screens to display sweeping graphics, deploying the kind of technology used to film TV shows like Disney+’s The Mandalorian. They had no decision desk for calling vote projections — which kinda seems the point of live election specials — forcing the audience to focus on the entertainment of seeing big-name guests spar with each other while Williams cited results originally reported on other news platforms.That turn toward entertainment benefits a candidate like Trump, who is an expert at building an image aimed at captivating and engaging people, using the news media as his messenger. Over his presidential campaign, there was plenty of coverage detailing what policies he proposed to advance in a second term — from extensive tariffs to mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.But I suspect what really moves many Trump fans is his unique charisma, turning rallies into a display where he can say and do things which would typically end a conventional politician’s career. (Remember what he did with a faulty microphone at a recent rally?)Helping him out are areas in media — and elsewhere — that pundit Matthew Sheffield has labeled “partisan ecosystems,” like Fox News Channel, Newsmax and conservative-friendly podcasters like Joe Rogan. Sheffield notes these corners of media can provide lots of important benefits to politicians: attacking political opponents, defending candidates’ behavior, keeping people loyal to the party and encouraging people who may feel negatively about the candidate to vote with the party.It’s a media environment where politics is often presented as an entertaining spectacle, with amped-up conflict featuring distinct heroes and villains.Over the past election season, my thoughts have turned many times to a legendary book, Neil Postman’s prescient 1985 analysis, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business — often used as a textbook in many media analysis and ethics classes. It argues a now-obvious idea: as entertainment becomes a larger element in news coverage, especially on TV, a political leader’s image and ability to entertain us may become more important than their actual policies or actions.And creating a powerful image is what Trump has excelled at, from his earliest days decades ago building his persona as a real estate baron in New York, to his modern incarnation as a political strongman promising to impose his will on American society. His supporters find him entertaining and feisty; even critics who hate his policies or his demeanor find it difficult to avoid talking about him.When Harris first stepped up to assume the Democratic nomination from President Joe Biden, it seemed she might have found a way to create her own spectacle — focusing the political conversation on her rapid rise, selection of a running mate, unique identity and the need to introduce herself to voters, despite serving as vice president for nearly four years.Watching the sitting vice president navigate a wave of media interest that included memes after pop star Charli XCX declared “Kamala is brat” and suggestions she go on the celebrities-interviewed-while-eating-hot-wings YouTube show Hot Ones, you couldn’t escape the sense that Harris faced pressure to entertain the public while explaining why she should be elected president.But that dynamic quickly changed again, as talk turned to the outrageousness of Trump’s actions — from using expletives to refer to Harris in speeches to presenting a rally in New York City featuring a comic who joked about Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” It seemed an extension of an ethic Trump developed long ago: That being talked about in the press is always better than not being talked about, even if people are mostly saying he’s terrible.And the media elements connected to his effort — from selling keepsake Bibles to hawking Trump-centered NFT’s with gaudy images and appearing with popular podcasters like Rogan — kept the public focused on the GOP candidate’s outsized image.Trump’s ability to yank back the spotlight persisted, even when Harris pulled off her own spectacles — like superstar endorsements from Beyoncé and an appearance on Saturday Night Live with her doppelganger, Maya Rudolph.Media ubiquity – where people are entertained and feel a connection to a big personality – doesn’t just excite supporters. It seems calculated to reach voters who are less involved in the political process, like undecideds and first timers.That kind of media ubiquity – where people are entertained and feel a connection to a big personality — doesn’t just excite supporters. It seems calculated to reach voters who are less involved in the political process, like undecideds and first timers. It also can make extreme policies seem more palatable, allowing supporters to shrug off or downplay Trump’s talk of prosecuting enemies or deporting masses of undocumented immigrants.What once struck me about conservatism in a simpler time — say, the days of George W. Bush and Sarah Palin — was that the party developed a way of talking about the issues anyone could adopt, like learning a language. But Trump’s ability to leverage media attention as entertainment seems more unique to him — something that legendarily awkward figures like JD Vance and Ron DeSantis might have trouble re-creating, raising questions about how lasting the impact may be.In the days and weeks to come, there will likely be a lot of columns like this, trying to make sense of a result that some didn’t see coming, and which heralds tremendous change for society and media.But it may be wise to consider how the rise of politics as entertainment, and the media’s contribution to that ascent, has shaped the current social landscape.Edited by Jennifer Vanasco.

CONTENT: I
t was the moment he had fantasized about for four years. At 2:24 a.m. on Nov. 6, Donald Trump strutted on stage in a Florida ballroom, surrounded by advisers, party leaders, family and friends. The Associated Press had yet to call the race, but it was clear by then that the voters had swept him back into power. Staring out at a sea of supporters sporting red MAGA hats, Trump basked in the all-but-certain triumph. “We’ve achieved the most incredible political thing,” Trump said. “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”How Trump, 78, won re-election will be the stuff of history books, and already America’s choice can be traced to some key decisions. To Trump’s top aides, the thesis of the campaign could be summed up in a simple slogan: “Max out the men and hold the women.” That meant emphasizing the economy and immigration, which Trump did relentlessly. It meant diverting attention away from the chaos of his first term, the abortion bans he ushered in, and his assault on American democracy four years ago. It meant a campaign that rode the resentment of disenchanted voters and capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited.Most of all, the outcome can be credited to a singular figure whose return to the White House traced a political arc unlike any in 250 years of American history. Trump left office in 2021 a pariah after inciting a mob of supporters to ransack the U.S. Capitol at the end of an attempt to overturn his electoral defeat. Three years later, he engineered an unprecedented political comeback. Trump effortlessly dispatched his GOP rivals, forced President Joe Biden out of the race, and vanquished Vice President Kamala Harris in a dominant victory that exceeded virtually everyone’s expectations. Along the way, Trump shrugged off a 34-count felony conviction and an array of other criminal indictments.Order your copy of this issue of TIMEThe scale of his success was stunning. Trump carried North Carolina, flipped Georgia back to his column, and smashed through the Blue Wall. His campaign outperformed its goal of turning out men and holding women. Exit polls showed Trump winning large numbers of Latino men in key battleground states, improving his numbers with that group in Pennsylvania from 27% to 42%. Nationally, Trump's support among Latino men leaped from 36% to 54%. Trump also increased his share of voters without a college degree, gained ground with Black voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and held steady nationally with white women, shocking Democrats who had expected a post-Dobbs uprising. Among first-time voters, Trump boosted his support from 32% four years ago to a 54% majority.Read More: How Far Trump Would Go.He got his share of big breaks. When Trump launched this campaign on the heels of a third straight rebuke in national elections, Republican leaders tried to ignore him. His primary opponents were too timid to take him on. A combination of friendly judges and legal postponements pushed his most damning criminal trials to after the election. Until July, Trump’s general-election opponent was an unpopular incumbent viewed by many as too old to continue in the job. Biden only confirmed those suspicions when he bumbled through their first, and only, debate. The Democrats’ hasty replacement of the first-term president with Harris deprived them of a better-tested candidate who could potentially have rallied broader support. Voters took Trump’s own advanced age and increasingly incoherent trail rhetoric in stride. Much of the country read Trump’s legal woes as part of a larger corrupt conspiracy to deny him, and them, power. And he benefited from a global restiveness in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that has ousted incumbent leaders around the world.The consequences may be historic. Trump has dominated American politics for nine years now, and after four years of his tumultuous presidency punctuated by an insurrection, the country chose to reinstall him. Trump campaigned on an authoritarian agenda that would upend America’s democratic norms, and he is already preparing to deliver on it: mass detention and deportations of migrants; revenge against political enemies via the justice system; deploying the military against his own civilians. How far he chooses to go with the power the public has handed him is a question that will shape the fate of the country.To the MAGA faithful, Trump’s victory is a thrilling vision coming into view. For the less fervent supporters who helped put him over the top, his rhetoric is largely bluster in service of reforming a government out of touch with America’s economic and social needs. To the rest of the country and much of the world, a second Trump term looks like a blow to democracy in the U.S. and beyond. That split screen will animate American discourse for the next four years. The nation is more polarized than at any point since the Civil War. But soon, there will be at least one thing that binds us all together: Come Jan. 20, we will all be living in Trump’s America. This account of how Trump did it, based on more than 20 interviews over the last eight months, offers a glimpse of what that may look like.As always, the strategy started with Trump’s instinct. In April 2023, he was huddled with advisers at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, days after he had made history as the first former President charged with a crime. The subject of the conversation: How could he control the political narrative? Trump had just gotten off the phone with his friend Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. There was a fight that Saturday in Miami. “I think those guys would love me,” Trump said.When Trump entered the arena on April 10, he was met with thunderous applause. While there, he ran into the Nelk Boys, a group of influencers who host a right-wing podcast. Trump had gone on their show a year earlier, but it was removed by YouTube for spreading election lies. The chance meeting led to a second appearance. His closest confidantes didn’t realize it at the time, but interviews on male-focused podcasts would become a throughline of his extraordinary political resurrection.

Read More: The Full Transcripts of Donald Trump’s Interviews With TIMEIt’s easy to forget how shaky Trump’s prospects seemed at the outset of his campaign. He announced his third bid for the White House in Nov. 2022, days after Republicans took a beating in the midterms—the third straight national election in which the former President was seen as a drag on his party. Trump’s hand-picked candidates embraced his lie that the 2020 election was stolen and lost critical races across the country. Elected Republicans took it as a sign that America was done with Trump and nearly all shunned his grievance-riddled kickoff speech at Mar-a-Lago. They just hoped he would fade away.But the early campaign launch turned out to be a savvy move, positioning Trump to cast his looming criminal prosecutions as politically motivated. With each indictment, he gained ground with the GOP base and raked in millions in cash. His primary challengers spent more time trying to beat up on each other than take out the man who stood in their way. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, arguably Trump’s most formidable opponent, dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. By March, Trump had secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Republican nominee. It was the fastest contested presidential primary in modern American history.Trump’s landslide in the primary was the product of a strategy honed by Trump’s two campaign managers: Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. Wiles, a veteran Florida-based strategist, had worked for DeSantis’s 2018 run for governor, but they had a falling out after he was sworn in. Following the 2020 presidential election, Wiles took charge of Trump’s primary PAC, Save America. In exile but already plotting his path back to Washington, Trump suspected his toughest obstacle in the 2024 primary would likely be DeSantis, sources close to him say. Who better to help him than Wiles? Wiles recruited LaCivita, a hard-nosed Republican operative. Together, they drafted the campaign’s strategy. The MAGA base was strong enough to assure Trump’s victory in the GOP primaries, they concluded, giving them time to test-run a plan to defeat Biden in November. Trump’s team focused on building an operation that could identify and turn out Trump supporters who were not reliable voters.Wiles and LaCivita, political director James Blair, and Trump’s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizo, believed that gender would be key. In 2020, Biden won by holding the same 13-point lead among women that Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016, while narrowing the gap among men by five points. “Men cost us the last election,” a top Trump campaign source says. “Our objective became not to let that happen again.” Surveys found that men, particularly young men, were turning away from Biden the most, especially over the economy. In a head-to-head matchup, Trump’s lead was the most dominant among unreliable male voters younger than 40. Advisers concentrated on activating this cohort, which, by and large, saw Biden as an elderly man who shouldn’t be President. These young men didn’t get their news from mainstream media and were less concerned with reproductive rights or democratic backsliding. When they did interact with politics, it was mostly through edgy bro podcasts and social media. They appreciated Trump’s brashness and habit of smashing norms. It was a risk to focus significant energy on turning out voters who don’t care much about politics. But LaCivita would often repeat a Winston Churchill line that became a campaign mantra: “To try to be safe everywhere is to be strong nowhere.” As Trump pursued the male vote, he also had to avoid losing women by larger margins than in 2016 and 2020—no easy feat after his Supreme Court appointments helped overturn Roe v. Wade and pave the way for abortion bans across the country. Whenever abortion came up, Trump insisted the issue was now up to the states, and pivoted as much as possible to the economy, immigration, and crime—issues the campaign believed triggered anxiety with well-to-do suburban women who were open to backing him.When Trump spoke with TIME in April 2024, Biden’s poll numbers were tanking and Trump’s camp believed they were well on their way to a decisive victory. In two interviews, Trump laid out a second-term agenda that would reshape America and its role in the world. All the while, a constellation of Trump-allied groups, such as the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and the Center for Renewing America, were laying the groundwork to implement Trump’s strongman vision. Many of their ideas—from imposing harsh abortion restrictions to gutting environmental protections and placing the entire federal bureaucracy under presidential control—were broadly unpopular with wide swaths of the electorate. But Trump seemed to think a victory in the fall was preordained.Read More: The Reinvention of J.D. Vance.The campaign’s confidence only grew over an intense three weeks that began with Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate performance. On July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt in Butler, Pa., with the shooter’s bullet piercing his ear and Trump rising to his feet and pumping his fist as blood streaked down his face, a spectacle of defiance that thrilled his supporters. Trump’s announcement of 39-year-old Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate at the Republican convention days later seemed like a statement of confidence that the MAGA movement would endure long after its leader exited the scene.The high didn’t last for long. Three days after the GOP convention concluded, Biden announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris. In a matter of days, the Vice President consolidated Democratic support. Soon she was outraising Trump by hundreds of millions of dollars, and hosting rallies that attracted the kind of attendance and enthusiasm her party hadn’t seen since the Obama era. Trump’s victory no longer seemed like a foregone conclusion.In a series of meetings in Palm Beach and at Trump’s New Jersey golf club, Wiles, LaCivita and their staff held bull sessions to address the threats posed by their new opponent. A younger candidate made it harder for them to attract voters disillusioned with Biden. Holding down losses with women while running against one would be even tougher. Democratic efforts to tie Trump to extreme agendas like that of Project 2025 were starting to bear fruit. Early internal polling indicated the challenge, according to Trump sources. Fabrizio had surveys showing that there was a broad appetite for change, and the biggest risk they had was letting Harris become the change-agent candidate. The Trump team began running ads, and having their surrogates go on cable television, blaming Harris for Biden’s presidency, surmising that she would inherit many of the same vulnerabilities of her boss. They focused on her role working on immigration for the Administration, in which she was assigned to address the root causes of migration from Central America, to blame her for a surge in border crossings. At the same time, Trump set out to distance himself from Project 2025, while working to paint Harris as further to the left than she really is.Privately, the campaign estimated that Trump’s message on abortion—to leave it to the states—was insufficient. Surveys showed that abortion rights were the third or fourth most important issue to voters. After months of Trump dancing around the issue of federal restrictions, Trump's top lieutenants told him it was time to address it head on. On Oct. 1, Trump posted on Truth Social that he wouldn’t support a national ban.Read More: How Trump 2.0 Would Remake Washington.There were internal challenges as well. Trump was becoming increasingly restless and agitated. He brought in allies from his previous campaigns, including Corey Lewandowski, one of his 2016 campaign managers. One of the most consistent proponents of “let Trump be Trump,” Lewandowski believed Wiles and LaCivita were blowing it, according to multiple campaign officials. In August, Lewandowski held a meeting with Trump in which he advised the Republican nominee to fire his entire campaign leadership, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Trump made no commitments but nodded and heard him out. Wiles and LaCivita soon held a meeting with Trump to say that Lewandowski was creating a distraction, throwing the campaign off course. What they have been doing has worked, Wiles told him, and it was not the time to deviate. Trump agreed. On his next plane ride, he held a meeting with all of them, including Lewandowski, who over the final weeks of the race was sidelined as an adviser, largely relegated to appearances on cable news.Harris’ momentum seemed to continue through September. She won the lone debate between the two candidates, baiting Trump into mistakes. “There was a lot of internal worry that she was a stronger opponent than we realized and that the ground has shifted,” says a top Trump official. But the campaign was relieved a week later, when polling showed that the debate hardly changed the race and that the candidates were tied. Trump returned to his mantra: accelerate the push to win over young, male voters. In late July, Wiles tasked Alex Bruesewitz, a 27-year-old GOP consultant, with presenting Trump with a list of online podcast personalities for interviews, several people familiar with the matter tell TIME. Bruesewitz and Danielle Alvarez, another Trump senior adviser, reached Trump on the golf course the next morning."I have a list of podcasts I wanted to pitch you on," Bruesewitz said. Trump stopped him there. "Have you talked this over with Barron?" he asked, referring to his 18-year-old son. "No, sir," Bruesewitz said. "Call Barron and see what he thinks and let me know," Trump said, and abruptly hung up. Bruesewitz reached Barron later that day and learned that he was particularly fond of Adin Ross, a provocateur mostly known for collaborating with celebrities on live-streams of video games, such as NBA2K and Grand Theft Auto. They agreed that’s where Trump should start. The podcast strategy was in motion.In August, Trump appeared on Ross’ podcast, which went viral, racking up millions of views on the livestream. The ensuing weeks were marked by a succession of fawning interviews with laddish podcast hosts: Logan Paul, Theo Von, Joe Rogan. The campaign made a deliberate decision to avoid most traditional media interviews.Trump took an unorthodox approach to outsiders. He neutralized a potential third-party threat by offering Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. control over health care policy in exchange for dropping out and endorsing him, Kennedy claimed. The campaign outsourced its most labor-intensive field operations in critical swing states to groups like Turning Point USA and America First Works. In the final weeks of the race, billionaire Elon Musk poured more than $100 million into his own political action committee to help Trump in swing states. Promised the leadership of a new “government efficiency commission” that would oversee the myriad federal agencies that regulate his companies, Musk hired staffers and incentivized them with payouts to reach voters. He personally camped out in Pennsylvania, seen by both sides as the pivotal battleground state, and handed out $1 million checks in sweepstakes for registered voters who signed a petition. Musk also turned X, his social media platform, into a cauldron of conspiracy theories and characterized the stakes of the race to his more than 200 million followers as existential. In the election’s final weeks, he promulgated the far-right conspiracy theory that Democrats were “importing” undocumented immigrants to swing states to irrevocably tilt the electoral map in their favor. “If Trump doesn’t win,” Musk said, “this is the last election.”As always, Trump’s self-destructive impulses posed a challenge. With a little more than a week before Election Day, he fulfilled a lifelong dream by holding a rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden. The event was marked by hateful, xenophobic and racist rhetoric by Trump’s warm-up speakers. The Trump campaign brought in an array of profane pugilists, including the insult comic Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The campaign did not vet his remarks or upload them into the teleprompter ahead of his routine, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly had recently gone on record saying that Trump praised Hitler’s generals. Trump’s former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Ret. Gen. Mark Milley, called him “fascist to the core.” Internal polling from the Harris campaign indicated that the odiousness of the rally was tipping late-deciding voters in her favor. It seemed like Trump might be imploding at the 11th hour.Shortly after 9 p.m. on Election Night, Trump entered a ballroom in his Mar-a-Lago club to a raucous ovation and a crowd full of his well-heeled benefactors. Behind him were his family members, including his son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara, and his youngest son Barron. For the next three and a half hours, he watched with glee alongside Musk and White as the returns rolled in even more favorably than his most bullish champions predicted.Trump’s transition team is stacked with loyalists like former Cabinet secretary Linda McMahon and businessman Howard Lutnick; his sons Don. Jr. and Eric; and his running mate Vance. All of them were tasked with making sure only true believers join his Administration-in-waiting. He’s expected to tap into the network of organizations that have been preparing to implement his ideas. That includes Russ Vought, his former director of the Office of Management and Budget who runs the Center for Renewing America, who has been crafting draft executive orders Trump can sign within his first hours as President.The first, and most aggressive, agenda item is expected to be immigration and the border. In his interview with TIME, Trump said he plans to use executive power to begin mass deportations of undocumented migrants, ordering the National Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and federal law enforcement to conduct raids. Tom Homan, a former Trump official now affiliated with Project 2025, is expected to lead the effort, according to campaign sources.At the same time, top Trump advisers tell TIME, there will be a massive purge of the federal bureaucracy. The most satisfying part of that to Trump, they say, will be firing Jack Smith, the Special Counsel prosecuting him on charges of willfully mishandling classified information and conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election.Trump’s most controversial moves are all but certain to face significant legal and political fights. He has vowed on the campaign trail to pick an attorney general who will investigate and prosecute his political rivals and critics. Trump will be emboldened by a Supreme Court ruling last summer that granted U.S. presidents potential immunity from some criminal prosecution for official acts. Between Trump’s psychological disposition, his vows to seek revenge on his adversaries, and the removal of many of the guardrails that hindered him in a first term, scholars of authoritarianism see a nation on the brink of crisis. Ultimately the election is as much a judgment on the American people as it is on the man they have returned to office. Trump’s comeback didn’t happen at random. By building a social and political movement that gave him coercive power over the Republican Party, Trump systematically demolished many of the nation’s long-standing norms, ushering in a cohort of lackeys who will enable his most autocratic impulses. He will enter his second term committed to creating a governing environment with few restraints on his power. He did not hide any of this. It was what the American people decided they wanted.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Republicans knocked off Democrats in two perennially contested U.S. House seats in eastern Pennsylvania while U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, one of the hardest right members of the chamber, survived a challenge in a southern Pennsylvania district with more moderate politics.The defeats of sixth-term Rep. Matt Cartwright and three-term Rep. Susan Wild came as the GOP’s U.S. House majority hung in the balance and Democrats seek a last line of resistance to Donald Trump’s second-term White House agenda.The Republican victories also ensure that the GOP has recaptured a majority of the state’s congressional delegation, now 10-7, since the party lost it in a slate of 2018 defeats.Republican Rob Bresnahan, a first-time candidate and developer who runs a family construction company, beat Cartwright in a district around Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Meanwhile, Ryan Mackenzie, a member of the state House of Representatives, beat Wild in a district around Allentown.Both districts hold narrow Democratic registration advantages, but Republicans have helped fund challengers to Cartwright and Wild for years in hopes of beating them.Both races were among the nation’s most expensive, with more than $35 million reported spent to the Federal Election Commission in the Wild-Mackenzie race and more than $31 million reported spent in the Cartwright-Bresnahan race.Cartwright was one of just five Democrats nationally to run for reelection in districts won by Trump in 2020, and the region has notably embraced Trump’s politics since the president-elect first ran for president in 2016.The sixth-term Perry beat Democrat Janelle Stelson, a first-time candidate and longtime local TV news anchor who is a Republican-turned-Democrat. About $22 million was reported spent in the race.Perry was chairman of the Freedom Caucus, a hardline faction of conservatives whose politics aren’t necessarily reflective of the fast-growing district around the cities of Harrisburg and York. Republicans hold a slight registration advantage in the district.Perry also has the distinction of being the only lawmaker to have his cellphone seized by FBI agents investigating the web of Trump loyalists who were central to his bid to remain in power in 2020.Perry has not been charged with a crime.Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, 14 other incumbents were reelected.That included Democrats Brendan Boyle and Dwight Evans of Philadelphia; Mary Gay Scanlon, Madeleine Dean and Chrissy Houlahan of suburban Philadelphia; and Summer Lee and Chris Deluzio from the Pittsburgh area.Republicans who were reelected were Guy Reschenthaler, Mike Kelly, Glenn Thompson and John Joyce from western Pennsylvania, as well as Dan Meuser, Lloyd Smucker and Bryan Fitzpatrick from eastern Pennsylvania.Follow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.

CONTENT: Kamala Harris's planned speech on Tuesday at Howard University, her alma mater, was supposed to be a "full circle" moment as she hosted an election watch party as part of a historic bid for the presidency.But the dream soured: that speech was cancelled and the campus instead became the venue for her concession speech on Wednesday."I'm so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it" she told those gathered."United by love of country and joy in our fight for America's future, we did it with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what divides us."In the end, it wasn't enough though: Donald Trump, who secured a far more resounding victory than the neck-and-neck polling had suggested, is the United State's President-Elect.The dream for Harris is over but there are signs that America may yet be ready for a woman in the Oval Office - it just didn't want one called Kamala Harris.It is technically possible that the vice president could lick her wounds and come back stronger in 2028, though her sizable defeat in what pollsters predicted would be a coin-toss election will make this a tough sell for the electorate. Perhaps more importantly, it could be a tough sell for some in her party.Professor Larry Sabato, founder and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told Newsweek that the defeats of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris would potentially "give some Democrats pause about choosing a third woman".However, Sabato stressed that "candidates matter" and believes that Democrats will choose whoever has enough talent.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, said that the party will "at least have women in the mix in primaries"."Women are positioned and well-positioned to run for the presidency now in ways that they weren't before," she said.A last-minute call-up, Harris was forced to campaign against the backdrop of a tough economic and geopolitical situation, but was nevertheless able "to run a very effective campaign," according to John Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt."There's very few political talents out there who could have pulled that off as smoothly as she did," he said.At the very least, it can be said that Harris's defeat has not weakened the possibility of a female president in the near future."In the US we're catching up with the rest of the world and being comfortable with women in power," Peter Loge, former senior advisor to the Obama administration, said.When Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016, it was a sign that Americans are "capable of pulling the lever" when given this chance, according to Walsh.Unlike Clinton, however, Harris did not dwell on the history-making aspect of her candidacy and the idea of Americans electing their first ever female Commander in Chief.This strategy drew the admiration of Nancy Pelosi in mid-October, who praised the candidate for "running on her strength" rather than on her gender.It proved ineffective among both men and women, however.According to exit polling conducted by NBC News for 10 key states, Harris underperformed against both Joe Biden and previous estimates of her high female support.Trump picked up the lion's share of the male electorate, beating out Harris 54 to 44 percent, and the results for women proved to be the direct inverse of this split. Biden won the female vote by a margin of 15 points in 2020, a damning comparison given Harris's clear attempts to mobilize this bloc around the issue of abortion.However, this election may come to be seen less as a referendum on female presidency, and more a reflection of Americans' concerns over the economy, immigration, and their enduring admiration for Trump, rather than inherent biases against female candidates.Voters may simply be waiting for the "right" woman to lead the country.They will have to overcome male competitors in their respective parties – JD Vance taking the MAGA mantle or Mayor Pete making another run – but several women are emerging as candidates for America's first female president.Former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Haley put up a respectable fight against Trump in the 2024 Republican Primaries, garnering just under 20 percent of the vote.Her Mar. 3 victory in Washington, D.C. marked the first time a woman had ever won a Republican Party presidential primary contest."If Donald Trump isn't on the ticket, one could imagine Haley picking up the mantle," Loge told Newsweek. "I think if the Republicans had nominated Ambassador Haley this year, she'd be measuring the drapes."Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley introduces Republican senate candidate, Dave McCormick at a campaign rally on October 30, 2024 in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania. Larry Sabato says Haley may struggle to regain the trust of her party in time for a 2028 run, having "already failed the loyalty test to the party's king."Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesHowever, a vestige of the pre-Trump GOP such as Haley would have to contend with the party's new MAGA image. Despite endorsing Trump, Haley walked out to boos at the Republican National Convention in July, and her call for "unity" in the party was met with a mixed response.Trump would have to "fade away" for Haley to ascend to the top of the party, according to Professor Sabato. "She has already failed the loyalty test to the party's king, and the Trump party would be unlikely to embrace her."However, Loge said that those attempting to act as a direct substitute for Trump in 2028 will ultimately fail, creating space for a more conventional, less bombastic candidate to take the Republican reins."If you look at the candidates who try to be MAGA and who aren't named Donald Trump, they do poorly," he said. "Donald Trump is exceptionally good at being Donald Trump. Nobody else is that good at it."Sarah Huckabee SandersThe most enduring of Trump's White House press secretaries during his first term, the Arkansas governor is well-positioned to carry forward his legacy in 2028.In her first day as governor, Sanders banned the term "LatinX" from being used in the state government, and her tenure has been defined by similar anti-woke moves that would draw cheers from the former president's base.Donald Trump on stage with Arkansas Gov.

How successful a strategy this would be, however, depends on the evolution of the party itself.While her endorsement of Kamala Harris likely burned many bridges with the GOP, Liz Cheney is still a Republican at heart, and has aspirations of taking her party back to its roots."I think Representative Cheney is looking for a Republican Party that she grew up in, that so many of my Republican friends grew up in, and she is not done," Loge told Newsweek.Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, left, with former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, right, during a town hall at Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield, Wisc., Monday, Oct. 21, 2024.

She's funny. She's insightful," Loge said. "She has a bright future. I don't know that it's in elected office, however."Despite never entering the contest in earnest, Governor Whitmer already garnered more interest as a potential president than any Michiganer since Gerald Ford, her popularity both state- and nationwide sparking the "draft Gretch" movement prior to Biden's withdrawal from the race.Professor Sabato said Whitmer would "make a strong candidate for the Democrats, though it's uncertain whether as a presidential or vice presidential nominee.""On the surface, one of the most appealing things about Governor Whitmer is that she's a governor," Peter Loge said. "Governors tend to get elected president because they run things, they can point to their state and say, I cut taxes, or I improved the schools, or I did a thing."With an established position in her party and state, and the proven policy acumen to boot, the self-described progressive Democrat stands out as a solid bet come 2028."Amy Klobuchar should not be underestimated. She's talented," Professor Geer said, while Peter Loge described the Minnesota senator as one of her party's "rising stars."Klobuchar beat out Republican Royce White for a fourth term in the Senate on Tuesday, handing her the Democrats one of their few sighs of relief in what proved a tough night for the party as a whole.Her previous attempts to lead her party have been less promising, garnering slim support in the 2020 primaries before dropping out one day before Super Tuesday.However, she won her state handily in 2018, racking up votes even in Minnesota's more pro-Trump regions, and her prosecutorial bona fides mean she shouldn't be dismissed as a future contender.Few can dispute the popularity of the former First Lady. In a July Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted amid growing calls for Biden's withdrawal, Obama was the only Democrat (Harris included) to beat Donald Trump in a hypothetical matchup."A lot of us here in Washington, D.C., we have a political crush on Michelle Obama," Peter Loge told Newsweek."She's smart. She's a terrific speaker. But I think she's made it pretty clear that she has no interest in politics.""Michelle Obama does not want to run for office," Professor Geer said. "She's made that clear countless times."Having turned 35 this October, there is nothing preventing the Democratic Party's outspoken socialist from making a run. When asked by Stephen Colbert in 2022, and by GQ a few months later, AOC refused to rule out the possibility."I think it might be a big leap for her, but I think she's incredibly popular," Loge told Newsweek.Following the defeat of a candidate whom opponents criticized as "far-left," however, the Democratic Party may retreat to the center, a shift that would likely remove AOC from the conversation.However AOC herself has evolved from left-wing disruptor to a more conventional Democrat - see her endorsement of Joe Biden despite his support of Israel's actions following Oct. 7.But even if she was able to overcome centrist headwinds within her own party, Professor Geer said that the young Democrat's ideology would be a tough sell for the American electorate at large."She's very young, very talented," Geer said. "But she'd have a very hard time winning the national election."Losing the popular vote - to which even Clinton could hold onto as a sign of her campaign's success - makes the case for her appeal to the American voter a difficult one.To return in 2028 would also see her break from the almost universal path of running for the Oval Office, failing, and returning to a lower rung political position, like Mitt Romney, John McCain and John Kerry, or shunning the political limelight altogether, and embarking on a more lucrative, less demanding career in public speaking, as with Hillary Clinton.If Harris chose to break this mold in 2028, she would have to contend with the inevitable "lame duck" label, but four more years of a Trump presidency – fresher in Americans' minds than during this cycle – may provide her with more ammunition next time around.Speaking to Newsweek prior to the election, Geer felt that the "immediate money" would be on Harris as the party's next nominee if she lost."The blame for the loss may well be placed more on Biden than on Harris," Professor Sabato added. "It's hard for a party's candidate of any gender to win when the incumbent party's president has job approval ratings in the 30's and low 40's."Alternatively, Harris could – like Richard Nixon in 1960 – swallow her defeat, sit by the sidelines, and re-emerge in 2032.Newsweek Is Committed To Journalism That'S Factual And Fair.Hold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.Hugh Cameron is Newsweek Live News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on international politics, conflict, and ... read more

CONTENT: Puerto Rico is holding a pivotal election on Tuesday that could reshape the island's political landscape, regardless of which of the two leading candidates emerges victorious.With a new challenger and the promise of unprecedented outcomes, this year's race has captured the attention of voters and analysts alike, offering a glimpse into the changing dynamics of the island's politics.At the forefront of the race is Jenniffer González, the candidate from the pro-statehood New Progressive Party (NPP).If González wins, it would mark a historic third consecutive term for the party, solidifying its influence and potentially strengthening Puerto Rico's push to become the 51st state of America.Puerto Ricans are being asked their opinion on the island's political status for the seventh time. The nonbinding referendum offers voters three options: statehood, independence, or independence with free association, which would allow Puerto Rico to negotiate matters such as foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship, and use of the U.S. dollar with the U.S. government.However, any change in Puerto Rico's status requires U.S. Congressional approval, making this vote largely symbolic for now.Voters are also being offered the opportunity to participate in a symbolic presidential vote. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not permitted to vote in U.S. presidential elections, but the symbolic ballot allows them to show support for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, despite the fact that their votes won't count toward the actual U.S. presidential election.Nearly two million voters are eligible to participate in the election, but voter apathy has been a persistent issue in recent years, with many residents disillusioned by the slow pace of change and the ongoing struggles with economic inequality and political corruption.On the other side is Juan Dalmau, representing the Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement, whose victory would make history as the first win by a candidate outside of the two major parties that have long dominated Puerto Rican politics.Trailing behind González and Dalmau in the polls is Jesús Manuel Ortiz of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), which advocates for maintaining Puerto Rico's territorial status.Rounding out the field is Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party formed just five years ago that has also begun to attract more attention in recent elections.For decades, the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party held an iron grip on the island's electoral system, with the two parties typically capturing over 90 percent of the vote.However, the political tide has shifted since 2016, as younger and more diverse parties—reflecting growing discontent with the traditional political establishment—have gained traction in the wake of economic challenges and political instability."There has been a major shift in Puerto Rican politics," said Jorge Schmidt Nieto, a political analyst and professor. "The dominance of the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party is being challenged in ways we haven't seen in decades."Despite heavy rain and flash flood warnings in San Juan and other parts of the island over recent days, voter turnout remained steady.Polls opened midmorning, and early reports indicated that hundreds were already waiting in line.However, the results of the election are expected to be delayed, with experts predicting that it could take several days before the full tally is announced.In the 2020 election, it took Puerto Rico's State Elections Commission four days to release preliminary results, and analysts expect similar delays this time.On Monday, the commission was still processing more than 220,000 early and absentee ballots, a count that has been delayed due to logistic issues.Jessika Padilla said around 40 percent of the early votes had been counted by the start of the week."This validation process is one that we are not going to take lightly," she said, stressing the importance of accuracy in the count.Over 5,000 prison inmates—out of about 7,400 incarcerated individuals—have also cast their votes, though it remains unclear how many of those ballots have been processed.In addition, multiple parties have raised concerns about irregularities, including allegations that some voters received early voting confirmations they never requested.The State Elections Commission has also deployed backup generators to over two dozen polling stations to ensure the process continues smoothly amid Puerto Rico's ongoing power grid issues, which have plagued the island for years.The upcoming election could test whether the rising influence of smaller parties will drive greater turnout, or if the traditional two-party dominance will persist.This article contains additional reporting from The Associated PressNewsweek Is Committed To Journalism That'S Factual And Fair.Hold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.Shamim Chowdhury is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on major international breaking news stories, in ... read more
